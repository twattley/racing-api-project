"9th of 20, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A slightly lower-quality renewal than the last couple of years, when a BHA mark in triple figures was required to get a run, and there were positional and tactical biases at play here, too, the field splitting into 2 groups, those drawn 18-23 staying towards the stand rail and left with little chance the way this developed, whilst a handy pitch proved an advantage in the bigger far-side group, the front pair in the firing line throughout; of those who didn't enjoy the rub of the green, Sonny Liston shaped well from a long way back and Al Mubhir did best of the stand-side contingent. | [HORSE]: shaped much better than the distance beaten suggests, first home in his group and having no chance with those who raced in the bigger far-side pack; prominent in group (raced stand side), ridden over 2f out, headway soon after, edged right, flattened out final 1f as effort of trying to get on terms with principals told; he's better handicapped than his last 2 starts in this sphere would suggest and he's not one to give up on in this type of event."
"2nd of 17, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive contest with no less than 6 previous course winners in attendance and, despite only 4 lengths covering almost half of the field, it still appeals as solid form, the thriving Aphelios leading home a pair of last-time-out winners with an unexposed 3-y-o who didn't get the clearest of runs hot on their heels; it developed in somewhat typical fashion for a 7f event here with those drawn in single figures coming to the fore, as well as it proving hard to get involved from the rear, the well-weighted pair Orbaan and Zip both worth marking up as a result. | [HORSE]: has made a generally positive start for the yard and, on softer ground than previously, turned in best effort of the season, beaten only by a thriving sort; mid-field, headway on bridle over 2f out, produced to lead 1f out, edged out final 100 yds."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: This looked a belting handicap beforehand, virtually all of these 3-y-os still improving and 6 of the 13 having won a handicap on their most recent start and, despite a steadier gallop than might have been expected, it seems sure to make for good form, the pair clear at the top of the weights coming out on top. | [HORSE]: took a step forward switched to a handicap, losing out only to one on a steep upward curve having been keener than ideal in a race that wasn't anything like as strongly run as expected; held up, not settle fully, progress into mid-field halfway, further headway under 2f out, challenged inside final 1f, every chance briefly last ½f, kept on."
"2nd of 10, competitive | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap won in comfortable fashion, but the race was marred when the promising favourite came down heavily after his rider had switched routes markedly 2f out, while the runner-up also suffered a troubled passage. | [HORSE]: hasn't won for a long time but stopped the slide back up in trip, looking unlucky not to finish closer, and she's dropped to a workable mark now; held up, pushed along 3f out, headway when no room from 2f out, forced to switch final 1f, ran on."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap that seemed to be run at an end-to-end gallop, but as is often the way around here, it still proved hard to get involved from too far back, and it probably isn't form to get carried away with. | [HORSE]: had been out of form but he goes well at this track and has won here in the past following some poor performances elsewhere. He was only caught in the final strides having hit 1.06 in running. The strong wind had been heavily favouring front-runners so whether he backs this up next time remains to be seen."
"Won | [RACE]: A couple of those with previous experience failed to meet expectations but this still looks form to view positively, newcomers filling 4 of the first 5 spots, the winner showing a smart turn of foot to come from what looked an unpromising position. | [HORSE]: (£18,000Y: by Territories: second foal: dam unraced half-sister to winners up to 1m Pearl Ice (useful) and Ancient Goddess out of useful 2-y-o 5f/6f winner Jezebel) looked potentially useful as she overcame some traffic problems to ultimately win with a bit to spare; waited with, still plenty to do 2f out, headway when forced to switch over 1f out, quickened to lead final 100 yds, won cosily; sure to improve."
"Won | [RACE]: What looked a very competitive 3-y-o handicap on paper proved to be anything but, Sir Lamorak in a league of his own, making up a lot of ground in the straight even considering that it was a well-run race. | [HORSE]: back on turf, made a mockery of his opening mark to follow up from last time, a group horse masquerading as a handicapper; waited with, still plenty to do 3f out, forced to switch early in straight, quickened to lead entering final 1f, edged left, forged clear, confidently ridden; will go on improving and presumably take in a Derby trial next."
"Won | [RACE]: A 1-2 in the race for Willie Mullins but not in the order many expected, Blue Lord the first beaten favourite in this Grade 1 contest since its inception. | [HORSE]: got back on track in no uncertain terms, this much more in keeping with the promise he'd shown as a novice last season, jumping better on the whole than he had here over Christmas and leaving his stablemate trailing with a couple of accurate leaps at the last 2; close up, awkward second, went on fifth, travelled well, shaken up 2 out, quickened clear approaching last, pushed out; he's already taken the scalp of the current Champion Chase favourite once, but Edwardstone looked to be feeling the effects of a tough campaign that day and the presence of Editeur du Gite means he's unlikely to get his own way in the Champion Chase."
"10th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that was run at a strong gallop set by Arenas del Tiempo, the first 2 coming from the second wave, Wonder Starelzaam proving better than ever back from a break. | [HORSE]: a sizable and scopey individual (who was 2lb well-in), failed to build positively on a pleasing recent Kempton effort. It later transpired that he'd bled from the nose."
"3rd of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A well-established Group 2 sprint, the race title slightly tweaked to avoid confusion with any other Dukes of York, the race itself looking on paper a little substandard overall and plenty not seeming at home on what looked a loose surface, but the winner was clearly much improved, the time in comparison to the preceding handicap giving scope for a really high view to be taken, a little more caution advised for now, conditions not sure to be so ideal for the winner another time. | [HORSE]: , third in the Champions Sprint at Ascot when last seen in October, was a little disappointing, especially considering he won the Gimcrack here as a 2yo, but maybe the run was needed."
"4th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: An open nursery run at a sound gallop, the much improved winner drawing right away having come from off the pace. | [HORSE]: in first-time cheekpieces, shaped similarly to last time making handicap, possibly not entirely straightforward but shaping as if well worth another go back over further; dwelt, in rear, outpaced over 2f out, ran on late, flashed tail."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: The strong-travelling winner was always well placed in this fair handicap, doing it with a little more in hand than the winning margin implies, though he'd have been pushed closer had the third got a better run through. | [HORSE]: winless this year, didn't get the best of trips but finished to good effect. He's not one to go overboard on but is on an exploitable mark."
"8th of 15, well beaten | [RACE]: The pick of only 2 with experience made full use of it in defying unflattering odds in a bumper run on deteriorating, churned-up ground, conditions that almost certainly counted against several of a raft of well-related newcomers from some high-profile stables. | [HORSE]: (by Jack Hobbs: seventh foal: half-sister to 3 winners, including fairly useful hurdlers Glimpse of Gala (19f-3m winner) and Mr Scrumpy (2½m-3m winner) (both by Passing Glance): dam, point winner, half-sister to useful chaser (stayed 29f) Strongbows Legend) bred to stay well, is probably one for later on; raced off the pace, outpaced end of back straight, late headway, found the test inadequate."
"13th of 18, well beaten | [RACE]: A well-run, big-field handicap and there's little reason to think it's anything but rock-solid form for the grade, the winner a long way ahead of the assessor at present, the runner-up in form, while the third and fourth both enjoyed a very productive 2020; the time was good, too. | [HORSE]: easy to back returning without the headgear in which he'd won at Haydock when last seen, probably needed the run after 8 months off; dived left leaving stalls, in rear, effort on inner 2f out, not unduly punished, never landed a blow."
"8th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: A handicap run at a steady gallop, which resulted in the field being well bunched for a long way and some trouble in running, but the principals can still be viewed positively, the first 2 home progressive 3-y-os whilst the third and fourth are below their last winning marks and the fifth did best of those held up. | [HORSE]: after just 5 days off, was flying too high in this grade (2 lb out of weights) and ran as well as could be expected; mid-division, raced freely, not clear run 2f out and shuffled back a bit, carried head bit awkwardly, not persevered with once held."
"2nd of 6, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The departures, along with the favourite's troubled run, created a prime opportunity for Ballycamus to quickly return to winning ways. | [HORSE]: a convincing all-the-way winner at Market Rasen in December off 12lb lower, showed no ill effects from his fall at the same venue on Boxing Day. However, he was almost taken off the track by the loose horse early on the final circuit and it clearly disrupted his rhythm. He warrants another chance."
"2nd of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A maiden that was dominated by a couple of hurdling debutants, the pair racing clear from very early on, Noble Yeats running out an impressive winner. | [HORSE]: (by Milan: third foal: half-brother to winning pointer Plus One (by Winged Love): dam unraced half-sister to useful hurdler/fair chaser (stayed 2½m) Balapour) successful on completed start in points 17 months earlier, shaped encouragingly on Rules debut; made running, joined when untidy fifth, ridden when flattened 3 out, left behind by winner before next; will surely improve, worth noting that all the other 3 finishers from his point victory (Boothill, Smurphy Enki and Ballybegg) are already fairly useful winning hurdlers."
"14th of 16, well beaten | [RACE]: A valuable handicap but most of these are known quantities and it strikes as solid rather than very strong form, the sole 3-y-o able to get right in the mix despite being 3 lb out of the weights; the pace was sound and the leaders were guilty of going for home too soon. | [HORSE]: ran poorly in first-time cheekpieces, his season in serious danger of turning disappointing at present given such a promising 3-y-o one; missed the break, raced off the pace, labouring 3f out, always behind."
"2nd of 10, competitive | [RACE]: The winner is most progressive and made short work of a badly-treated bunch on the way to clocking up a hat-trick, travelling with aplomb and settling things quickly once hitting the front. | [HORSE]: blinkered for his nursery debut, had shown some promise on his first two starts and simply bumped into a handicap blot. He was wayward when coming under pressure but will find easier openings than this and can win soon."
"6th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: A sprint finish from 3 out to end a maiden with several hallmarks of ropey form, including the proximity of a runner-up beaten in a seller the time before as well as the unconsidered front-running third. | [HORSE]: was possibly flattered in a muddling race on his hurdling debut and hasn't stood enough racing as yet to be confident he'll build on it, anyway; waited with, took strong hold, out wide, progress out wide still 3 out, effort flattened out."
"4th of 20, involved in finish | [RACE]: This looked a competitive event prior, though both a positional and track bias mean it's not form to take fully at face value, those who raced prominently on the far side seen to the biggest advantage, with the 4 lowest drawn runners making the first 5, whilst none of the group of 8 that raced stand side finished in the top half and the majority can have their efforts either upgraded or excused, Brazen Bolt first home in that group, shaping much better than the result implies. | [HORSE]: had the benefit of a good track position and confirmed return to form; raced far side, led overall, driven 2f out, tackled over 1f out, headed soon after, one paced."
"5th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A tight handicap on paper and just that on the track too, especially with the pace just modest, the first 2 racing alongside each other throughout and sweeping through in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: turned in going well enough but he had to work a passage from the back of the field and didn't get an entirely clear run at things. He'd been off since August and this was his first run back from a wind op, so it was an encouraging effort. He's very well treated on last year's best form, so is one to keep an eye on."
"3rd of 22, involved in finish | [RACE]: As fiercely a competitive handicap as the numbers suggested, the main action happening more towards the near side in the finish and Pressure's On was always in a good spot just behind the pace, a whole host of closers in behind him shaping well given troubled passages, not least his fellow dead-heater, Quest For Fun, who looked unlucky not get the outright success. | [HORSE]: ran well back in the right grade, one of many to emerge with credit having suffered a troubled passage, though not quite as unlucky as Quest For Fun; held up, headway when short of room 2f out, ridden when switched last ½f, ran on."
"4th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: A competitive contest for the level with plenty lurking on dangerous marks, the winner one of them, though it was a familiar story to most of the card, the rail proving a major advantage - the field all tracking across to it soon after the start - with the first 2 coming from high draws, that factored in with a strong pace meaning the winner was seen to good effect, whilst those who raced on the speed and/or on the outer flank can either be excused or marked up, Dream Together and Mumcat the pair of most immediate interest as a result. | [HORSE]: who sweated up beforehand, is on a very handy mark but is a frustrating sort (long-standing maiden) who needs everything to fall right, ending up a bit away from the action here but also helped by coming from off a strong pace; steadied at the start, patiently ridden, not settle fully, pushed along under 2f out, denied a run until 1f out, ran on late, never on terms."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: No great pace on in this handicap and the best horse probably finished second, Pressure's On conceding first run to Follow Your Heart, who was never far away. | [HORSE]: had ended 2024 on the up and shaped well after 4 months off, going like the best horse at the weights; held up, pushed along early in straight, headway over 1f out, finished well but conceded first run; he's one to look out for."
"2nd of 17, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap contested by 3-y-os, many of them unexposed, but not the strength in depth associated with such races given the draw bias, the field initially racing as 2 groups before merging after 2f or so, those drawn low clearly at an advantage, Buick giving the winner Harry Magnus a peach of a ride to come with his challenge of the far side and winning with a bit in hand. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, was sent off favourite and ran at least as well as previously after 6 months off; in touch, good headway over 2f out, led over 1f out, headed final 50 yds; he's made a promising start to his career and ought to be winning before long, clearly posessing more stamina than might be expected given his sprinting pedigree."
"8th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: A well-run handicap but the finished was still fought out by a pair that were always prominent, the third home having only one behind turning in. | [HORSE]: who got tightened up for room and was shuffled back to the rear in the early stages, ran on when it was all over. This is one to put a line through."
"3rd of 7, competitive | [RACE]: An interesting race for the grade in which the pace was contested, the second and third having something to recommend them but proving no match for a 3-y-o improver building a good all-weather record. | [HORSE]: less exposed than the rest, was well backed and shaped better than the bare result back down in trip, left with a lot to do after an awkward start; in rear, short of room 2f out, headway 1f out, stayed on, nearest at the finish; will remain of interest."
"7th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The pace was sound but the gaps didn't come in time for the well-backed favourite. | [HORSE]: didn't run up to market expectations. It turned out he'd bled from the nose. Also, he had a small wound on his right hind and had lost both front shoes, so he had his share of excuses."
"Won | [RACE]: A one-sided affair, the veteran winner back in some form now and extracting himself from some trouble to bolt up and mark himself down as one to follow over the coming weeks. | [HORSE]: who'd been in freefall in the ratings, rather barged his way out inside the final furlong, but he won with plenty to spare and could take some stopping should connections find him another opportunity under a penalty. His jockey picked up a five-day ban for improper riding."
"4th of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap run at a modest pace and the winner was much better placed than the trio that chased him home, all having something to recommend them. | [HORSE]: is a hostage to fortune the way he is ridden and although he again ran into trouble when attempting to close, it's hard to say it made the difference between victory and defeat."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: With neither of the Newmarket-trained 4-y-os that dominated the market meeting expectations, this is perhaps not as strong a race as it looked like being, the runner-up rather left alone in front too, but the winner still deserves credit for running him down with authority, even if he got a good run up the inner. | [HORSE]: after 5 months off, shaped as if amiss (reported post-race to be suffering from atrial fibrillation); chased leader, folded tamely over 4f out; he did something similar on his second start last year before bouncing right back the next time."
"2nd of 11, competitive | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap blown apart by a rapidly-improving filly, Pandora's Gift quickening right away once given the office, the runner-up sticking on best of the rest from the rear but unable to lay a glove on the impressive winner. | [HORSE]: was never in the same parish as the winner, but this was still a good effort to reach second late on as he was dropped right out from the widest stall early. He won't always come up against such a progressive sort."
"3rd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: Several of these met here earlier in the month on very deep ground, but once again all they heard was Radio Goo Goo, who led home a pair of last-time-out winners. | [HORSE]: a winner on all-weather when last seen, shaped well on handicap debut after 7 months off, suggesting 7f should be well within her compass after overcoming a tricky path to finish as close as she did; in rear, effort over 2f out, came wide soon after, still plenty to do entering final 1f, ran on, nearest at the finish."
"Won | [RACE]: They raced in one group down the centre to far side, to the detriment of those drawn high and it got rather congested, which brought complications for some in low stalls that weren't in the front rank, and backers of both Juan Les Pins and Sugar Baby could consider themselves unlucky with Aberama Gold and Ingleby Arch better placed and fighting it out. | [HORSE]: placed at Ayr five days earlier, was well backed with a visor reapplied (replacing blinkers) and he dug deep to score for the first time since October 2023. He has fallen significantly in the weights over the past year and, given that he also handles soft ground, could be the ideal type for a crack at the Ayr Silver Cup. Presumably, he'll be taking in Goodwood in the interim."
"7th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A messy contest in which the in-form pair that came clear were seen to far better effect than some of those behind. | [HORSE]: bidding for a C&D hat-trick from a 3lb higher mark, looked to be cruising when produced to challenge over a furlong out but found disappointingly little off the bridle."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful contest that developed only from early in the straight, a likeable 3-y-o coming out on top, though it was the well-treated runner-up who shaped best from the rear. | [HORSE]: proved retains all ability returned to a shorter trip after 14 months off, challenging from a less-than-ideal position and looked after once his chance of winning had gone; dwelt, held up, headway under pressure under 2f out, kept on, not unduly punished."
"8th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: The 3-y-os were unsurprisingly towards the head of the betting in this fairly useful contest and an improver from that age group went close behind one that had fallen plenty in the weights; it developed only from 2f out with nothing getting involved from the rear and it also got a bit messy in the bunched finish for the minor places, Streak Lightning most inconvenienced, whilst the well-supported favourite isn't one to be giving up on just yet granted a stiffer test. | [HORSE]: , with a tongue-tie added for the first time, shaped better than his finishing position, rallying late having been denied a clear run and lost his position. He can be given another chance."
"2nd of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Some fierce fractions set by Kracking, with Masqool dragged into doing too much in pursuit, and it was only the winner who truly coped with such an exacting examination, most of the rest showing a foible of some sort or other. | [HORSE]: without the headgear this time, got back on track to some extent from a reduced mark; held up, progress 2f out, took second 1f out, carried head bit awkwardly, plugged on but absolutely no impression on winner."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that showed the winner to good effect from the front, Goddess of Fire fending off the joint favourites, both of whom make more appeal for next time. | [HORSE]: well backed after 7 months off and left the impression he should have made a winning return, suited by the drop back in trip (saw things out better than was sometimes the case at 3 yrs) but just unable to peg back one who enjoyed first run; mid-field, headway out wide 2f out, challenged final 1f, stayed on; will remain of interest."
"8th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A muddling low-grade handicap which saw the field finish in a heap, the winning favourite controlling matters from her plum draw, both the second and third shaping better on the day, having had to wait for a run. | [HORSE]: ran better than last time without ever threatening; in rear, ridden early in straight, plugged on, never a threat, would have benefited from a stronger gallop."
"27th of 29, well beaten | [RACE]: Year-on-year this proves to be one of the most competititve 3-y-o handicaps, the number of last-time-out winners in double figures, with a few of those chasing hat-tricks and generally progressive sorts aplenty, though there's a suspicion this may not prove one of the strongest renewals in recent times, with improvers in short supply on the day and very few marking themselves out as pattern race performers of the future, the winner a very obvious exception, his burst to the front and then second kick inside the final 1f giving him the air of one destined for bigger things; the field raced in 3 distinct groups, with the far side group in front much of the way, though the leaders there probably overdid it and the principals came from the other groups, the pair who pulled a little way clear racing in the centre, while the next 4 home all raced stand side. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect and his Sandown second probably remains the effort on which to make judgement; dwelt, raced far side, in rear, brief headway over 1f out, not knocked about, never on terms."
"Won | [RACE]: An established field of handicappers led home by the most senior of them; the pace was brisk thanks to the third, burning off most of them. | [HORSE]: wasted no time getting back on track, a marked change of tactics coming in just the right race as it turned out, doing his bit to make up for a blank 2022 as he made it 2 wins from his last 3 starts; held up, steady headway from 3f out, led entering final 1f, soon clear, suited by the strong pace."
"4th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steady gallop ensured all seven runners held a chance turning in, the fourth very likely to have played a part in the finish granted a clear passage. | [HORSE]: is another whose one previous AW run stood out in comparison with her turf efforts (16lb higher on RPRs). Fitted with a tongue-tie for her return to synthetics, she had it to do from the back of the field given the way the race was run. Even so, she travelled best into the straight and would surely have gone close to winning had she got the breaks when she needed them. She should find a similar race."
"7th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A competitive affair run at a fair gallop, a pair that arrived in good heart able to pull a long way clear. | [HORSE]: shaped better than the bare result and can be treated as if still in good heart; waited with, took keen hold, headway when not clear run 2f out, met some trouble again final 1f, finished with running left."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive handicap in which the majority involved in the finish came from mid-field or further back, one that boasts some really strong recent form chased home by a last-time-out winner, the third doing well to get involved having blown the start and the handicap debutant in fourth very much one to be interested in at a similar level. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden, did well to get as close as she did given the ground she forfeited at the start, clearly on a handy mark but a tough one to go too overboard about given she needs everything to fall right given her running style; reared start, raced off the pace, good headway 2f out, keeping on when hung left entering final 1f, never nearer."
"Won | [RACE]: A distinctly one-sided handicap, the unexposed winner dispatching mostly averagely treated rivals with notable ease. | [HORSE]: had his Kempton form boosted by the third last week and showed himself to be well ahead of his mark in his second handicap, quickening clear in the style of a potentially smart colt. He'd be very hard to beat under a penalty."
"5th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: They split into 2 groups in this good-quality handicap, theose drawn high dominating on the near side, the winner in the form of his life right now, while Count D'orsay deserves plenty of credit for coming out best of those that raced on the far side. | [HORSE]: ran a cracker from his unfavourable draw, winning his race on the far side clearly. It's a long time since he got his head in front overall, but on this evidence he is capable of winning again off this sort of mark."
"4th of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A tight finish to a decidedly ordinary contest, the fourth probably the only one worth noting going forward, the run an eye-catching one considering he's still rough around the edges. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, shaped well making handicap debut, still looking green but doing good late work once the penny started to drop; slowly into stride, in rear, headway when switched over 1f out, kept on final 1f, nearest at the finish; he's got the ability to win modest races this winter, probably back over further."
"3rd of 20, involved in finish | [RACE]: A lack of unexposed sorts gave the form a solid rather than strong look, though it was a typically competitive affair, the well-in favourite giving it a bold go from the front and picked off only late on by a trio which included the gambled-on winner and a last-time-out scorer, though it was the third who would have collected with a clear run; the field elected to come towards the stand rail and a high draw wasn't a usual disadvantage as a result, the runner-up and fifth doing best of those on the other flank. | [HORSE]: returned to form back up in trip and back on a sound surface. He didn't get a clear run when starting to make his ground and he's one to keep onside either on turf or AW."
"Won | [RACE]: All bar one of these were 3-y-os, the sole older horse failing to beat any of his younger rivals, but it's probably unwise to rate this form that highly on account of a modest gallop, the winner seeming much better equipped to cope with it than the runner-up. | [HORSE]: became the second of the pace forcers that ended up out the back in the King George V Handicap to bounce straight back and win next time, a steadily-run 1¼m looking far more her thing, having far too many gears for her male rivals; in touch, travelled well, close up 3f out, produced to lead under 2f out, quickened clear inside final 1f, comfortably."
"5th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A basement-grade nursery, the gambled-on winner proving a different proposition on nursery debut; the field was quickly strung out courtesy of Miss Ayala and Molly Mac taking each other on up top. | [HORSE]: is better judged on her win the time before, overdoing the front-running having got across from the widest stall; made running, headed over 3f out, shaken up 2f out, led again briefly early in straight, weakening when hung right final 1f."
"10th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A handicap that should throw up winners in the coming weeks, the winner thriving whilst the second and fourth were both better than the bare result. | [HORSE]: back on all-weather, after 8 weeks off, shaped better than the distance beaten suggests; mid-division, keeping on when no room final 1f, not recover."
"10th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: Plenty underperformed in an ordinary staying handicap, the winner finding a bit of improvement for a step up in trip. | [HORSE]: had headgear fitted having often made his life tough with slow starts, but he was still sluggishly away before his rider rushed him up to be on the heels of the leader. He found little for pressure and dropped right away and isn't one to be backing at short odds too often."
"3rd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A borderline useful handicap featuring an even mix of three-year-olds and older horses, one from either category fighting out a very close finish, the winner coming from a long way back in a well-run race. | [HORSE]: ran really well back down slightly in trip, doing best of those ridden close up in a well-run affair while his rider lost a rein in the latter stages, too; prominent, shaken up over 3f out, edged ahead 2f out, headed final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: Not a bad race for the grade, the thriving winner doing this in good style while there was also promise to be taken from a couple coming down the weights in a truly-run contest. | [HORSE]: completed the 4-timer with his smoothest success yet under a penalty after just 4 days off, getting a good tow in behind a contested lead and quickly putting this to bed in the final 1f, hard to rule out in better handicaps than this in current heart; stumbled start, prominent, travelled well, challenged over 1f out, led final 1f, quickened clear, won readily."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: The pace didn't really pick up until after halfway and it paid to be prominent. | [HORSE]: is best not judged on this run as his race was effectively ended through no fault of his own early on; waited with, hampered over 5f out, went amiss and eased off (found to have sustained wounds to a hind leg)."
"4th of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: The pace held up with the first 3 home in those positions throughout, Without Delay recording her third C&D success as the fourth caught the eye from the rear of the field. | [HORSE]: , having another go over a mile but on better ground this time, ran into some traffic difficulties inside the final 2f and finished with petrol left in the tank under his inexperienced jockey, who'd picked up a ten-day ban the last time she rode him. He hasn't won for ages but has now twice caught the eye in his last three starts."
"5th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: Most of the field were aged 3 or 4 but one of the remainder - both of whom are well into the veteran stage - managed to win and the other one was an unlucky-in-running and fast-finishing fifth, which suggests the form is no better than ordinary for the grade. | [HORSE]: the oldest in the race, finished with a flourish having lost his place early in the home straight. He loves soft ground and retains enough ability to think he can win again."
"5th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: An open-looking handicap, unexposed sorts in short supply, though the well-backed winner was having just his third run on turf and found a fair bit of improvement, a strong pace favouring those more patiently ridden, the field keeping off the inside rail in the straight. | [HORSE]: ran creditably, turning in easily his best effort of the year, shaping a bit better than the bare result as well, having nothing left late on after forcing the pace but still having best of those that raced prominently; led, ridden 3f out, headed over 1f out, left behind by winner, weakened final 50 yds."
"Won | [RACE]: The winner quickly bagged the far rail in this fairly useful handicap, that proving to be decisive as he was never headed; the pair that elected to race in the centre were never in it. | [HORSE]: who hadn't been given a hard time on reappearance, came on markedly for that and produced a career best, though whether he's quite so good as this makes him seem is open to debate, getting things his own way on an inside rail that looked to be playing pretty kindly; made all on far rail, ridden under 2f out, kept on, always holding on."
"Won | [RACE]: A valuable sprint handicap and strong-looking form, acknowledging the now-typical York draw bias was at play, those drawn high largely struggling to get involved and the efforts of Strike Red and Arctic Thunder worth marking up given their position on the near side. | [HORSE]: has had his detractors but did enough in a new tongue-tie/cheekpiece combination to land another nice pot. He's won in blinkers in the past and, while there's a chance headgear becomes less effective and he still comes with risks, the son of Blue Point is a force to be reckoned with in these big handicaps. He was cut to 12-1 from 16-1 by Paddy Power for the Stewards' Cup."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful handicap won in good style by a veteran who rolled back the years, Documenting always in a good spot just behind the pace and putting this to bed while a couple of fancied runners met some trouble, notably Cephalus. | [HORSE]: didn't get a completely clear shot at it from a rear-field position in the straight. This effort can be marked up and he seems well capable of landing a race from a mark in the 80s."
"14th of 17, well beaten | [RACE]: A competitive contest with no less than 6 previous course winners in attendance and, despite only 4 lengths covering almost half of the field, it still appeals as solid form, the thriving Aphelios leading home a pair of last-time-out winners with an unexposed 3-y-o who didn't get the clearest of runs hot on their heels; it developed in somewhat typical fashion for a 7f event here with those drawn in single figures coming to the fore, as well as it proving hard to get involved from the rear, the well-weighted pair Orbaan and Zip both worth marking up as a result. | [HORSE]: one of the least exposed, is better judged on previous form down in grade having ended up nearest the stand rail and away from the action, for all that she has work to do from opening mark; dwelt, raced well off the pace, went in snatches, headway under pressure out wide under 3f out, left behind over 1f out."
"4th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A typical race of its kind, won in comprehensive style by one having his very first run in such company. | [HORSE]: was strong in the betting down in grade, but not for the first time was hindered as much by his own quirks as anything else, going as well as any when meeting trouble but then not going through with his effort fully once in the clear; held up, travelled well, not clear run over 2f out, forced to switch over 1f out, chased leaders final 1f, not run on; temperament under suspicion."
"2nd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: This appeals as sound form, the winner, along with the third, very solid yardsticks, though the ex-German runner-up appeals as the most interesting prospect going forward. | [HORSE]: 3-3 in Germany for her previous yard, is bred to stay well. The good gallop also helped her, but this was still too short for her. She was edging closer with every stride as the line approached, and will appreciate moving up to 1m4f plus."
"Won | [RACE]: Probably the strongest renewal yet of a race that was run on the round course in 3 previous editions, a regally-bred sort pulling clear along with the favourite, that pair finding improvement in a race that has tended to be short on such types in previous years; the front pair were both drawn high and raced in the smaller group centre-to-stand side, but there's a strong case that they were simply best at the weights as opposed to holding an advantage racing on that part of the track, that they were prominently positioned as the groups merged after halfway probably more salient, with those from off the pace failing to land much of a blow. | [HORSE]: who bolted up in a mile Windsor maiden in October before racing keenly and being outstayed over 1m2f on soft ground at Haydock on her handicap/seasonal return, remained well treated from a mark of 85 given her breeding, by Sea The Stars out of the brilliant Treve, parents with three Arc wins between them, and she gradually wore down the favourite, proving ideally suited by the stiff mile."
"Won | [RACE]: A good handicap for the grade, the winner reappearing with a useful effort, the second also on a good mark, while a few others will do better for the outing. | [HORSE]: without the headgear this time, won on reappearance here last year and repeated the trick with a really taking effort after 8 months off, clearly better than this grade on his day and hopefully he'll kick on from this winning start better than he did last time around; prominent, travelled well, quickened to lead over 1f out, drew clear, had plenty in hand; his stable couldn't be in better form right now."
"2nd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A soundly-run race and probably a strong race of its type, a trio of 3-y-os filling the first 3 places and the front pair in particular worth being positive about, both better than the bare result for differing reasons. | [HORSE]: again looked comfortably ahead of her mark back in handicap company, now unfortunate on both of her visits to this track, although markedly so on this occasion. Given plenty to do, she was repeatedly denied a run before finishing strongly. She's one to keep on side and should make a better 4yo."
"2nd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: Just the 6 runners, but they grouped towards the stand rail, and the third found all the trouble going, the fourth not seen to advantage either, the winner scoring decisively, despite looking less than straightforward. | [HORSE]: making turf debut, ran well on just her second handicap start, though perhaps flattered to finish ahead of the third and fourth, having the run of the race too; led, ridden over 2f out, headed 1f out, not quicken inside final 1f."
"3rd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: Very solid-looking end-of-season form, run at a true clip and in-form ones coming to the fore. | [HORSE]: ran well upped in trip for handicap debut despite racing with plenty of enthusiasm. She looks to be on a good mark if she learns to settle."
"4th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Fair form from the first 3 home, Agostino justfying favouritism on his return as he comfortably recorded a fourth course success. | [HORSE]: wasn't disgraced given a bit more time between races, needing everything to drop right given he often races off the pace; shuffled back after 1f, in rear, bit short of room over 1f out, stayed on final 1f, never landed a blow."
"Won | [RACE]: A tightly-knit handicap on paper but a sound gallop sorted them out, the hold-up pair coming clear of the rest late on. | [HORSE]: turned in an improved display on this first run since October at a course that doesn't usually favour those held up. He won a shade snugly and could develop into a useful handicapper this season."
"Won | [RACE]: Solid form for the grade, the winner – as reliable as they come at this level – just doing enough to fend off an improver after the pair had worn down one arriving on the back of a string of good runs. | [HORSE]: back on AW, ended up being dropped in as the early pace was contested and that proved no bad thing, able to sneak his way into contention in the home straight. He will be forced into Class 4 company in the short term but he should remain of interest at this track (4-10 here as opposed to 0-25 elsewhere)."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that was run at a sound gallop, that and the longer trip seeming catalysts for an improved effort from the winner and with a few in behind shaping better than the bare result, this has the makings of a race that will work out, especially with these 3-y-os having the option of taking on their elders. | [HORSE]: was strong in the betting on first outing since leaving Tom Dascombe, shaping promisingly and while he wouldn't have beaten the winner whatever, he was unlucky not to finish closer; chased leaders, not settle fully, shuffled back home turn, had to wait for gap over 1f out, stayed on, finished with running left; he's got some good form earlier in the season and shouldn't be long in winning races."
"6th of 26, fairly beaten | [RACE]: They split into 3 groups in this good-quality 3-y-o handicap, those on the far side disadvantaged compared to the rest, the finish fought out by a pair of improvers, the winner switching to the centre from the near side to launch his bid, while the winner drifted towards him in the final 1f, possible that lug cost him the race given the narrow margin he was beaten. | [HORSE]: was knocked back towards the rear of the field when getting hampered, but she flashed home for sixth. She'd most likely have been third with a clear run and is on the upgrade, while she won't mind returning to 6f."
"2nd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: Quite an interesting race for the grade, even with a couple of non-runners, several of these looking on handy marks, the prolific Barrolo scoring again quite comfortably after he'd hampered the second and third inside the final 1f, better positioned the way this developed than that pair, too. | [HORSE]: is knocking on the door and proved his effectiveness for this 2f longer trip; waited with, took keen hold, headway over 2f out, keeping on when snatched up/forced to switch inside final 1f before edging the head bob for second; he ought to be winning sooner rather than later."
"19th of 19, well beaten | [RACE]: A pair of outsiders filling the first 2 positions felt rather fitting considering the muddling nature of this year's Kensington Palace, as the complexion of a soundly-run race changed relay-style in the straight, the winner played last of the principals - and also widest of them - after others had trodden a similar path to get to the front briefly before she struck, any number on their inside not getting the gaps when needed as they returned very well clustered. | [HORSE]: , back in trip from this wide draw returned to handicaps, again raced keenly and proved a disappointment, her rider reporting she met with interference."
"5th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap which went the way the market suggested, Solanna just a bit more consistent than the rest of these, but the main story of the race was the performance of the second who lost 10+ lengths at the start yet was still able to throw down a strong challenge in a truly-run race. | [HORSE]: , gelded since his last start in July, and tackling a longer trip on his AW debut, was a late gamble from 33-1. He had a nice tow into the race and had his chance, but couldn't deliver when it mattered and dropped away late on. The run might bring him on, though."
"Won | [RACE]: A truly-run handicap which finally saw the winning favourite exploit a tumbling mark, those in and around the frame giving this a solid enough look for the lowly grade. | [HORSE]: gained his first win since June 2022, when he landed a Group 3 for Aidan O'Brien. He's tumbled in the handicap since, albeit running plenty of decent races, and won this off a new career-low mark. He's well capable of following this up but his profile suggests it's unlikely."
"6th of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: Track position proved vital, as this developed into a 2½ furlong dash, the winner making all on handicap debut and capping a fine weekend for his yard after their Stewards' Cup exploits 24 hours earlier. | [HORSE]: ran moderately in first-time cheekpieces after 6 weeks off, not that far out of her ground when the tempo increased but soon taken off her feet; handy, not quicken 2f out, held when hampered over 1f out, left behind."
"2nd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap, but one in which well-treated ones looked thin on the ground, whilst there was also a track bias at play, things developing towards the far side, a couple who ended up marooned in the centre of the track better than the bare result, notably the fourth. | [HORSE]: raced with the choke out but put a below-par performance at Ascot behind. Although this was his best effort at a mile, he'll unlikely mind the return to 7f."
"4th of 29, competitive | [RACE]: With as many as 18 making their handicap debut this was unsurprisingly a deep contest, as it usually is, 7 of the first 10 doing so with the front pair taking their form to a smart level, the winner looking a group performer in an event that takes a little bit of explaining; they split into 2 groups with the 11 lowest drawn runners going far side, that contingent slightly ahead at halfway, though it was the stand-side group who came firmly to the fore, providing the first 7 home, with Magical Sunset best of the other side, the majority from that group either worth marking up or best excused the run, some also meeting trouble; the pace was a strong one with both sets of leaders going off too hard and it suited the closers, both Candle of Hope and Novus worth marking up considerably from those ridden prominently, winners bound to come from this. | [HORSE]: ran well making handicap debut in the hottest event confined to just her own sex all season, beaten by a trio who came from further back; dwelt, raced near side, soon in touch, travelled well, every chance under 2f out, edged right entering final 1f, not quicken."
"7th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: Several in-form horses for a class 6, while the winner was the least exposed, but a slow pace necessitates a slightly cautious view of the form; the field came to the stand side in the straight with the first 2 closest to the rail. | [HORSE]: a four-time winner over C&D including this race last year from 2lb higher, can be forgiven this as he saw no daylight for most of the home straight."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Only a nose in it at the line between 2 horses who went the through the race in contrasting fashions, the front-running Radio Goo Goo quickening early in the straight after setting a sound pace and having just enough in hand to deny the soon-detached Bosh an unlikely victory. | [HORSE]: on his first visit to Chester, was outpaced in last for much of this but launched a strong bid from over a furlong out and narrowly missed out. He would have won in another stride or two."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Only the 3 who pulled a little way clear in this minor event managed to better poor form, the sound gallop soon having most of the field out of their comfort zone. | [HORSE]: after just 5 days off, was strong in the betting and again ran well, but perhaps wasn't giving it 100% at the death; close up, loomed up 2f out, shaken up soon after, every chance final 1f, worried out of it."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A trio that had contested the Britannia, including the third and the fifth, took on 5 going up in grade, 3 of them handicap debutants, the Ascot third just prevailing over a 66/1-on Brighton winner, the latter bumping the former and earning his rider a 4-day ban, the race overall rather messy and the form possibly muddling; the field raced as one group up the centre after around 1f, the runner-up setting a fair tempo. | [HORSE]: had no more than a piece of work in a match at Brighton recently, beating a filly who's been given a BHA mark of 29. He nearly made all but the winner was on his tail when he began to hang to the right, which was compounded when Jamie Spencer switched the stick to his left hand. He couldn't quite hold on but it was a fine effort from this strong gelding."
"4th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A rough, low-grade contest with plenty finding trouble at some stage, most notably the fourth who would have been second granted a clear passage. | [HORSE]: down in grade, was unlucky not to finish closer upped in trip, likely to have finished second if not for suffering late interference; bumped start, raced wide, mid-division, ridden home turn, good headway soon after, every chance when snatched up last ½f, not recover; still unexposed and will remain of interest."
"6th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A sound gallop on softish ground made for a good test, Prince Alex back to the sort of form he was showing a few seasons back and encouraging first runs of the year from the third and sixth. | [HORSE]: shaped encouragingly on first outing since leaving P. Twomey (for 32,000 gns) after 18 months off, gelded in the interim and leaving the firm impression that he'll benefit from the run, still lightly raced for a 6-y-o and no surprise if this yard can get more out of him (has an entry in the Chester Cup); tracked pace, led under pressure under 3f out, headed under 2f out, no extra final 1f."
"5th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap, albeit not an overly deep one, the winner breaking a lengthy losing run on just third start for current yard. | [HORSE]: after 5 months off, wasn't seen to best effect; raced off the pace, short of room home turn, effort when not clear run early in straight, switched approaching final 1f, kept on, never nearer; he's in the veteran stage now but is one to bear in mind with this under his belt."
"4th of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steadily-run apprentice contest and the form has a muddling look to it, the thriving winner scoring with more in hand than the margin suggests. | [HORSE]: produced a laboured effort and needs treating with some caution after this; held up, steady headway 2f out, flashed tail final 1f, one paced."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: Competitive stuff, though the time was around a second slower than for the earlier division, the early pace not that strong with plenty pulling for their head, not least the winner. | [HORSE]: had a visor fitted for the first time this season and ran his best race since last year's Great St Wilfrid, recovering well after losing his pitch after a couple of furlongs; mid-field, lost place before halfway, headway over 2f out, ridden approaching 1f out, ran on; he's potentially well treated at present, this his lowest turf mark for over 4 years, no surprise if he takes advantage before much longer."
"Won | [RACE]: A maximum field for the race that brings the curtain down on the Dante Festival and it was a fiercely competitive affair, 5 of them last-time-out winners, and all bar one finished in the first 6; the pace was brisk from the outset and it set up for those from mid-field or further back, veteran Mums Tipple not only faring easily the best of those who raced prominently but best of all, going at least 4 lengths clear at one stage before a penalised pair who’d avoided any trouble by challenging near side short through to wear him down close home, this not anywhere near as messy as the 3-y-o handicap over this trip on Wednesday but it still including a few hard-luck stories, notably the fourth and last year’s winner. | [HORSE]: is improving in leaps and bounds since her recent stable switch, overcoming the rise in class (penalised for last weekend's success) to make it 2-2 for this yard - one which excels with new recruits - displaying a fine turn of foot, still with just a couple behind her halfway up the straight; waited with, still plenty to do over 2f out, met some trouble over 1f out, rapid headway out wide entering final 1f, edged left, led close home, won very readily; holds an couple of entries early next week and she'll take some beating under another penalty in either of those."
"5th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful sprint handicap run at a strong gallop courtesy of Lihou, the winner coming from well back to win the race for the second successive year. | [HORSE]: caught the eye with her finish down in class after her rider got his reins a little jumbled for a few strides as they made progress."
"3rd of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A field made up almost exclusively of 3-y-os and it seems sure to prove good form for the grade despite a couple of disappointments on the day, the winner well suited by the increased test of stamina; due to damage sustained to the stalls following the opening contest on the card, this and subsequent races were flag starts. | [HORSE]: had made up into a smart chaser this year for W. P. Mullins (sold 100,000 gns) and shaped encouragingly enough back on the level (successful on the last of 3 starts in French maidens at 3 yrs) for her new yard, likely to need more of a test (stays 3¼m over jumps) to show her best in this code; waited with, steady progress from 4f out, edged right 2f out, took third inside final 1f, kept on."
"18th of 19, well beaten | [RACE]: The top-weight was racing from a 10 lb lower mark than the official ceiling but it was still an exceptionally strong running of this long-standing and extremely valuable 3-y-o handicap, this perhaps the deepest renewal for some time in fact, the majority stepping up in trip, over half of the field handicap debutants and as many as 9 of them last-time-out winners, the first 2 from the last-named camp; as tends to be the case in middle-distance events here high draws came to the fore, though the highly progressive pair that led them home charted rather different paths, the runner-up electing to stay wide early before taking up a prominent pitch, whilst the winner stayed out there throughout and adopted a much more patient approach; the gallop wasn’t as strong as the following Ribblesdale – they reached the 3f pole around a second slower in this – but it was still a well-run affair, it proving difficult for those in the second half of the field to land a major blow, however, the exciting winner worth marking up plenty as a result, as are Sing Us A Song and Daiquiri Bay who fared best of those from right out the back. | [HORSE]: , a stablemate of the runner-up, dropped away disappointingly soon after turning into the straight."
"5th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A modest maiden handicap in which the winner came from well off a sound pace, the runner-up shaping well in faring best of those ridden prominently. | [HORSE]: was hassled up front and had nothing more to give when the challengers arrived. Sam James dropped his hands shortly before the winning post and told the stewards that in his opinion fourth-placed Wurkin Ninetofive had already passed him when he stopped riding. His explanation was noted."
"11th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A biggish field but a lowly grade and few of these are of much interest at all, prompting a relatively cautious view of what the first 2 achieved in coming clear, the timefigure only very ordinary after all. | [HORSE]: remains with one standout effort this year, and his temperament looks dubious on the back of this; prominent, starting to weaken when short of room briefly around 3f out, downed tools."
"6th of 10, competitive | [RACE]: Those held up failed to land a blow - a few missed lost ground in the flag start - but this still looks good form for the grade, an improver showing a good attitude to hold off a pair who arrived on the back of a win, another recent scorer completing the frame. | [HORSE]: was strong in the betting and is best not judged on this, things going wrong from an early stage; slowly into stride, in rear, hampered after 2f, steady progress 2f out, stayed on gradually, never dangerous."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair 3-y-o handicap on balance, the winner going one better than last time after having a better run through than the less-experienced second. | [HORSE]: ridden by good-value claimer on handicap debut, wasn't seen to best effect, struggling for room while the winner charted a clear passage, then showing his inexperience once in the clear; in touch, short of room over 1f out, forced to switch final 1f, ran green and hung left, kept on; he shouldn't be long in going one better."
"6th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: A competitive handicap which was truly run and has a strong look to it with those in the frame coming a little way clear, the first 2 both making their ground deep on the track from low draws and the runner-up could take higher order if building on this reappearance. | [HORSE]: had been struggling on turf and didn't fire back on all-weather, not getting the clearest of runs but still finding less than looked likely even once in the clear; held up, headway when not clear run over 1f out, switched final 1f, effort flattened out."
"12th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: This wasn't as competitive as it looked beforehand, plenty behind the pair who pulled clear not on their game, but the efforts of that leading duo look solid enough, both having run well when last seen. | [HORSE]: who won on his final start for Andrew Balding (sold for 46,000 gns), was upped in grade, ridden more patiently and against his elders for the first time 5 weeks on, and offered little; dwelt, raced off the pace, ridden soon after halfway, never a threat."
"4th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Rule 4 10p in £ applies to all SPs A handicap in which more than half of the field were 3-y-os, and one of the 2 most interesting of those showed improved form to come out on top under a positive ride, the other proving to be a disappointment; Flamenco Fan was withdrawn having been unruly in the stalls. | [HORSE]: returned to form in first-time cheekpieces, the drop in trip suiting well, worth rating as though finishing a little closer too, his rider stopping riding late on with a bandage on Secret Strength's left fore having come loose; mid-division, headway over 2f out, switched over 1f out, held when short of room final 100 yds."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Probably good form for the grade, with a progressive winner chased home most closely by a pair that had recently switched stables. | [HORSE]: without a tongue strap this time, wasn't seen to best effect but continues to prove expensive to follow, his losing clear evidence of one that needs delivering to perfection; slowly into stride, in rear, had to pick way through straight, never nearer."
"Won | [RACE]: A well-contested fillies' handicap and the form should work out, a pair in top form clear of one that had a luckless passage, Absolute Queen giving WIlliam Buick a 4-timer on the card. | [HORSE]: followed up her Bath success from a 4 lb higher mark, seeing the further trip out well given she was plenty keen enough early on; handy, not settle fully, going well when not clear run over 2f out, quickened to lead approaching final 1f, joined soon after, edged ahead again post."
"2nd of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Quite an open handicap on paper but it proved anything but, Without Compromise looking full value for a big step forward, even if he was quite well positioned and avoided the trouble that befell a few of those behind caused mainly by the hanging Molinari. | [HORSE]: had been in a malaise under both codes since returning from a break in October but got right back on track in first-time tongue strap, unlucky not to finish closer, too, not that he'd have got close to the ready winner even so; mid-field, no room from over 2f out, got gap inside final 1f, ran on and took second final 50 yds."
"10th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap on balance for what is a prestigious prize in the lady amateur ranks, one of the few progressive ones first across the line but disqualified due to his rider's overuse of the whip; the early pace was ordinary but picked up far enough out to ensure there wasn't much advantage one way or another, trouble in running for Chillingham deciding the order in which the first 2 passed the post for all My Dream World's jockey had problems of her own early on. | [HORSE]: in a change of headgear, has possibly gone off the boil a shade after a productive April; raced off the pace, struggling under 3f out, never dangerous."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A good pot for a 0-90 and in-form sorts led them home, the thoroughly likeable winner battling well to deny the favourite who is chasing a valuable Sunday Series bonus. | [HORSE]: less exposed than the rest, especially so as a stayer, is in the form of his life and went agonisingly close to collecting a £100,000 bonus for 3 wins in a season in the Sunday Series, Evaluation having suffered the same fate in 2022; dwelt, in touch, pushed along over 2f out, led briefly 2f out, stuck to task; he'll get another chance at Pontefract later in the month and will surely go there with leading claims once more, the stiff nature of the track likely to be right up his street."
"14th of 14, well beaten | [RACE]: Unsurprisingly for a backend handicap run on bad ground, there were a few disappointments, but the form still appeals as reasonable, the winner confirming himself back in good heart, chased home by one who has quickly found his feet for a new yard and a couple who haven't had much racing, this quartet pulling a little way clear. | [HORSE]: stopped quickly under conditions that should have suited but he was found to have bled from the nose."
"Won | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap, but it did go to an unexposed type who asserted well late on having still looked a touch green when first asked for her effort. | [HORSE]: had three quick runs over further last month and she left those well behind dropped in trip and switched to a low-grade handicap for the first time. She still looked green under pressure, lugging right from over 1f out, but she was strong through the line and won going away. This looks solid form for 0-55 company and she could be the type to run up a sequence."
"8th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: A tight finish saw the first 3 home separated by little more than a neck at the line, the runner-up just failing in her bid to follow a recent success and splitting a pair that still have plenty of untapped potential. | [HORSE]: prominent in the betting in first-time cheekpieces, was messed about a bit at the start but was on and off the bridle throughout."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A race shaped by an overly-strong pace, the front 2 coming from rear out wide to pick up a group who'd been racing for about 2f already. | [HORSE]: seemed undone by a 4lb rise in his hat-trick bid, needing no excuses. He's started well for this stable and should remain competitive."
"4th of 7, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The winners of the previous 2 renewals of this fairly useful event came firmly to the fore, one that had fallen in the weights benefiting from the fitting of headgear and also racing closest to the stand rail, the places completed by a 3-y-o; there was some interference 2f out with Intervention and Urban Sprawl most affected but it had little impact on the result in truth; as per the preceding event over this distance, the stalls were moved forward approximately 30 yds due to a patch of false ground, the remaining race on the card over a longer trip abandoned as a result. | [HORSE]: ran a typical race, ending up more towards the centre and away from the stand rail, worth repeating that a return to sprinting may be beneficial; raced wide, soon steadied, typically took strong hold, ridden when forced to switch under 2f out, steady progress 1f out, never on terms."
"8th of 17, well beaten | [RACE]: An exposed bunch but the form of a soundly-run amateur riders' event makes plenty of sense. | [HORSE]: very easy to back, ultimately finished well held having a rare turf start, the outing probably needed after 7 months off; tracked pace, not clear run briefly 3f out, carried head awkwardly, dropped away."
"11th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A competitive handicap, with the field congregating on the near-side rail, the front pair 3-y-os with fewer miles on the clock than most, those 2 up there throughout and clear of any trouble, while several further back weren't seen to anything like best effect. | [HORSE]: was another who ran into traffic problems on the stands' side and finished without being asked a question. This was an opportunity missed given he was 7lb well in at the weights."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive handicap for the grade, though one run at just a modest gallop, the pair who battled out the finish always handy. | [HORSE]: an in-form mare going back up in trip, battled all the way to the line. She would have won this but for hanging persistently and is capable of scoring again off this sort of mark."
"6th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A handicap blown open by a strong gallop under testing conditions, the favourite soon floundering, and the result might well have been different had Morris not switched off the inside, the winner taking advantage of the gap that had been vacated. | [HORSE]: in first-time cheekpieces after 9 weeks off, was very tight in the betting making turf debut but ran no sort of race; dived right leaving stalls, soon behind and badly outpaced, laboured headway over 1f out, effort flattened out."
"Won | [RACE]: Very much the type of race that would produce a different result were it to be run again, the field finishing in a heap, a couple of the more likely sorts below their very best and an unreliable sort edging home by the skin of her teeth. | [HORSE]: is an all-or-nothing character, but boasts a decent strike rate for all her foibles and pulled another victory out of the bag by the narrowest of margins, notching up a third C&D success in the process; dwelt, close up, typically took strong hold, every chance entering final 1f, carried head bit awkwardly, edged ahead post; she's unproven on the all-weather and is just as likely to run poorly next time as back this up."
"4th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: Typically just modest form in this 0-50, but it looks reliable form for the grade, underpinned by a strong gallop, Atrafan never far away and holding off some strong finishers, the runner-up theoretically unlucky, but the architect of his own downfall. | [HORSE]: most versatile trip-wise, did well to finish as close as this after being short of room at a crucial stage. The return to further should suit but this habitual slow-starter has had a stack of chances since her last win in 2020."
"6th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A low-grade nursery with a contested pace, the favourite picked off late on by an improver from the rear, the closing sectionals suggesting he was even better than the result . | [HORSE]: well backed, wasn't seen to best effect making handicap debut over 1f shorter trip; in touch, short of room from 2f out, not quicken final 1f, not unduly punished; remains capable of better."
"12th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful 3-y-o handicap with no great depth to it, but there is plenty to recommend the first 3, the winner travelling strongly and finding enough to edge out a fellow improver; the action unfolded down the centre, the third staying on well up the near rail. | [HORSE]: gelded since last seen, progressed well last year but stopped quickly on first outing since leaving Jane Chapple-Hyam after 7 months off (sold for 30,000 gns); mid-field, pushed along 2f out, folded tamely."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: This race is often a rich source of good 3-y-o handicap winners, and this year's contest - a deep one on paper - looks likely to prove no different, with the winner - one of 3 in the race with a classic entry - producing a really likeable effort from the front to score in a good time. | [HORSE]: ran well after six months off, just unable to see through his challenge. He should progress some more."
"3rd of 18, involved in finish | [RACE]: A big-field contest, though one ran at a start-stop gallop, the field fanning almost the width of the track in the straight with those who came near side dominating the finish, one fought out between a handicap debutant and a progressive last-time-out winner with the former just holding on, whilst those on the other wing can have their efforts either upgraded or excused. | [HORSE]: fared best of those to race prominently and she can win again back at 1m2f."
"Won | [RACE]: A strong gallop favoured those who came from mid-field or further back, but Raging Raj still did well to pull this out of the fire having met a fair bit of trouble. | [HORSE]: up 4lb for a narrow defeat on his handicap debut, was a real standout in the paddock and justified strong market support, doing remarkably well to win, having been repeatedly checked in his run from over 2f out. He should be capable of adding to this success."
"5th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: The pattern on the afternoon for coming stand side in the straight was well established by this race and a high draw was a help as a result, those that raced more towards the centre from low draws knowing their fate a long way out. | [HORSE]: a stablemate of the fourth, did well to get the lead having reared when the stalls opened. He went well for a long way, getting back on track following a poor effort behind Delegate This Lord here last time."
"7th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A couple of these pulled clear, the winner having his first run for a new stable and the runner-up a recent winner, so they are worth viewing positively, with the third a reliable sort. | [HORSE]: has been keen on occasions but was simply far too free in first-time visor (wore cheekpieces last 3 starts); led, refused to settle, headed under 2f out, weakened, did too much too soon."
"6th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A standard 3-y-o handicap which saw the second respond well to an aggressive ride, but the progressive favourite came through to score by a clear margin for the second time in a row. | [HORSE]: well backed, shaped better than the bare result; dwelt, raced wide, raced off the pace, headway 1f out, effort flattened out, left poorly placed; not one to write off."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sprint handicap blown apart by the classy winner, Cover Up quickening right away from exposed rivals. | [HORSE]: has been in great form of late and ran another solid race. He simply bumped into one who's a level above."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A nursery featuring 3 last-time-out winners, as well as others than came here on the back of a good run, and likely to be form to view reasonably positively; the field raced up the centre, except for Pacifica Pier, who raced solo up the stand rail. | [HORSE]: was unable to complete the hat-trick back under a fully-fledged rider, but he didn't really have the rub of the green and ran well in defeat, coming through for second late on but finding the winner pulling out extra; short of room soon after start, in rear, shaken up under 3f out, headway over 1f out, took second well inside final 1f, kept on; he's likely to go well again."
"20th of 20, well beaten | [RACE]: Only the second running of this competitive event, though with the market leaders disappointing and - unsurprisingly with the exclusion of 3-y-os - improvers thin on the ground, it's no more than useful form, the race itself similar in many ways to last year, a well-run contest but it proved hard for many to make inroads from the rear, high draws also predominantly coming to the fore, no coincidence that they were able to avoid the scrimmaging towards the inner, the fourth shaping a bit better than the distance beaten suggests, as did Farhh To Shy further back. | [HORSE]: arrived with a positive profile and was sent off favourite, but clearly wasn't 100% on the day; dwelt, soon in touch, ridden 3f out, weakened 2f out, eased final 1f."
"5th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A basement-grade affair in which the short-priced favourite proved bitterly disappointing and only the first 2 home bettered poor form. | [HORSE]: lost all chance at the start so ran a decent race in the circumstances. She has previously got upset in the stalls and still has issues with them but has the ability to win a minor race if breaking on terms."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful contest than unfolded towards the stand rail, the pair that pulled clear - namely the sole last-time-out winner and one that had plummeted in the weights - both drawn high but it seemed a level playing field, the latter one to note now that he's back on track, this very much his time of year. | [HORSE]: , down in trip and returned to soft ground, has dropped 16lb since March and posted his best effort of the year in the first-time blinkers. He pulled clear of the rest and, as he's won from this trip to a mile, should have plenty of options."
"3rd of 6, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The favourite may have failed to meet expectations in this handicap, leaving the door open for Diderot, but it was still hard not to be impressed with the manner of his success, powering clear off an ordinary gallop. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, proved to be a disappointment; chased leader, not settle fully, got gap early in straight, every chance over 1f out, found less than looked likely; he looks worth a try in a hood to help him settle, but it could be that his standout effort, which came on heavy ground, flatters him slightly."
"7th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: Form to take with a pinch of salt, the first 2 home seemingly helped by racing closest to the stand-side rail, while those that stayed in the centre were never in it and ended up well beaten. | [HORSE]: is best forgiven this run, one of several in the centre that had little chance; raced on worst of ground, mid-field, ridden over 2f out, made no impression, left poorly placed."
"5th of 5, competitive | [RACE]: An intriguing 3-y-o event despite the lack of numbers and it was taken apart in the final 1f by a well-backed handicap debutant, Dance In The Storm worth marking up even further after overcoming the run of the race. | [HORSE]: looked to have been let off lightly by the handicapper with his Kempton success starting to work out well, but was easy to back and failed to find the required turn of foot after bagging an uncontested lead, the return to firmer ground a possible factor (has a rounded action); dictated, kicked on over 2f out, headed over 1f out, one paced; in top hands and remains with potential."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: It was only Austrian Theory's late progress that prevented a clean sweep of the places for 3-y-os and this has the hallmarks of very solid form, the first 4 all interesting for one reason or another and a little way clear of last year's winner, with the highly progressive Crowd Quake not seen to anything like best effect a place further back. | [HORSE]: attracted support and would likely have finished a clear second had he enjoyed better luck. Although he's not won since his debut, he's capable of winning races from this sort of mark."
"7th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A basement-level minor event, but at least 3 of the 4 who pulled a little way clear arrived in good form. | [HORSE]: who'd had a breathing operation, might have needed the run after 9 weeks off; dwelt, raced off the pace, forced very wide entering straight, right cheekpiece came loose under 2f out, kept on."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Low-grade fare in which an unconsidered handicap debutante edged out the well-backed favourite, the pair drawing clear of the sole previous winner in the field late on. | [HORSE]: was well backed down in grade and duly ran his best race but, not for the first time, looked a tricky customer; close up, travelled smoothly, upsides 2f out, carried head awkwardly/looked hesitent, edged out close home."
"4th of 5, competitive | [RACE]: Not exactly a deep race but bits and pieces of form to think it wasn't bad for the grade, though with the caveat that the pace was slow and conditions had already got very testing by this stage of the card. | [HORSE]: upped in trip, was really well backed but couldn't reward that weight of money, already starting to come off second or third best when impeded; missed the break, mid-field, not settle fully, upsides under 4f out, struggling to quicken with winner when hampered on far rail over 1f out, not recover; perhaps he's better ridden more positively like he was in a much warmer race at Sandown."
"9th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: An ordinary timefigure tempers enthusiasm a little but otherwise there are good reasons to think this is strong form, with 2 progressive and prolific types pulling well clear in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: found this too competitive from out the handicap, a fillies 0-75 likely to be a better environment to test her effectiveness on turf; prominent, lost place 2f out."
"8th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap in which the pace was on the modest side, the hold-up horses struggling to land a blow, but the form looks solid, several that are down to workable marks finishing in behind the back-to-form winner. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect; poorly drawn, raced wide, in touch, ridden 3f out, weakened final 1f, not ideally placed."
"3rd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A basement-grade contest that unfolded into a dash up the straight, the winner overcoming the run of things from the rear. | [HORSE]: a winner over 1m4f here in January, was sent off a well-backed favourite. Having travelled strongly, it looked as though his supporters would be rewarded once he was sent on, but he was swamped by a couple of stronger finishers. It would be harsh to suggest that the longer trip found him out."
"3rd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap, the first 3 all having been in the frame in the same race at Chelmsford earlier in the month, the longer trip and a good ride seeing Dibble Dabble comprehensively reverse form with the other pair. | [HORSE]: had beaten the first 2 last time but had nothing like so much in his favour here, a lot going wrong over 2f longer trip and he's certainly not one to write off from this mark; prominent, travelled fluently, hampered 5f out, going well but no room and shuffled back over 2f out, headway when rider dropped whip 1f out, kept on; will remain of interest."
"5th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: This got a little messy late on with a couple inconvenienced, most notably the second, but she'd still have struggled to match the improved winner, who quickened up nicely from off the pace on just second start for a new yard. | [HORSE]: back down in trip for her handicap debut, endured a nightmare passage against the inside rail and is worth another chance."
"Won | [RACE]: All the money was for the winner and he took control of a well-run race entering the final 1f, the runner-up a clear best of the rest but with too much ground to make up from last. | [HORSE]: finished third behind a couple of smart performers on his debut and only previous AW start. He arrived on the back of a solid effort at Beverley, and stepped up here, travelling nicely in behind the pace and quickening up well to take over in the straight. He did flash his tail under pressure but saw it out, and there's likely more to come on the AW."
"7th of 16, competitive | [RACE]: Everything a big-field 3-y-o sprint handicap should be, run at strong pace with most having their chance, Up The Pace causing a shock as he held off the second favourite in determined fashion; the field came as one down the centre and the draw had little impact. | [HORSE]: failed to repeat last effort back on turf, Kiniro doing little for that form as well though a position on the far wing is rarely ideal in big fields here; dived left leaving stalls, held up, headway over 2f out, not sustain effort."
"9th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A fair handicap in which the unexposed winner found sufficient improvement to just hold off one who has refound some form of late having dropped a long way in the weights. | [HORSE]: failed to build on the promise of last 2 runs but wasn't seen to best effect from the widest stall; steadied at the start, raced wide, held up, pushed along early in straight, not quicken; he's not one to write off at potentially big odds next time."
"Won | [RACE]: A weak handicap overall but it went to one that's thriving at present, Porfin doing well to come from what looked an unpromising position. | [HORSE]: has thrived since joining this yard and took advantage of a good bit of placing to make it 3 wins from his last 4 starts, certainly not getting things his own way as he did over 7f last time, doing well to get up having looked to have a mountain to climb turning in; in rear, ridden home turn, still plenty to do approaching final 1f, stayed on to lead final 50 yds, had bit in hand; will continue to take all the beating."
"6th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A few of these are of interest for the level, and it could well produce winners, but it was quite messy on the night and the bare form isn't the most reliable, the fifth and sixth unlucky not to finish closer. | [HORSE]: who got a bump at the start and was keen towards the back early on, didn't have the race run to suit, so it was a good effort to finish as close as he did. Hopefully the first-time blinkers weren't wasted."
"7th of 23, fairly beaten | [RACE]: This was just the fifth ever running of this handicap and only the second on the straight course; the key feature of this year’s renewal was a pronounced track bias, with those in the near side group holding a significant advantage given they were already appreciably ahead of their far side counterparts well before halfway, the imbalance obviously rendering the race less competitive, with only one runner from the far side group managing to finish in the top half of the field; that said, the winner’s performance was still well up to standard in the context of the race’s short history, and the overall time compared favourably with the preceding Hunt Cup. | [HORSE]: who'd won over C&D in May, was all the rage to be this year's first royal winner but was done for a change of gear then hung when feeling the pinch. She still retains the potential to do better."
"2nd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handful of exposed older horses with mixed records made for a very weak handicap for the level. | [HORSE]: wasted no time getting back on track in a race that went more his way, not lying down even though he'd again taken charge of his claimer; made running, took strong hold, drew clear before halfway, closed down straight, shaken up 2f out, worn down only late on."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap, with the last 2 winners of the race again on show, and one of them came out on top again under a good ride. | [HORSE]: who won this race from 5 lb higher 2 years earlier, confirmed the promise of his Pontefract second, going one better under a good front-running ride; broke fast, raced clear, closed down 2f out, ridden over 1f out, headed briefly and looked sure to be swamped, found extra."
"14th of 15, well beaten | [RACE]: Those drawn in double figures had little chance the way this panned out, the action developing down the centre, with the consistent winner doing it in cosy fashion to lead home a 1-2 for the Iain Jardine stable. | [HORSE]: hasn't been in much form but had little chance from a poor draw this time, also reported to have bled from the nose; raced off the pace, never involved."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Farcical scenes early on with Neil Callan riding a finish after 5 furlongs of this 2-mile contest, but the 3 that came to the fore are all going the right way at this trip so that gives the form some substance, even if the second could have been quite a bit closer with a clearer run. | [HORSE]: was more competitive on this switch to modest handicaps, albeit he didn't have any real excuses. He is in good hands to carry on progressing."
"6th of 19, involved in finish | [RACE]: A typically-competitive renewal of this fillies' sprint handicap, the draw not having as much of an effect as it often can in sprints here, the field spread across the track with the speedy Eclairage towing those drawn high into it, while the admirable Luna A Inbhir Nis gave a good lead to those drawn lower, the race essentially setting up for those ridden with a touch of patience, a Ryan Moore masterclass putting the winner's head in front on the line, while those 2 aforementioned prominent racers emerged with plenty of credit, the form looking solid all round. | [HORSE]: wasn't disgraced, finding the race panning out more to her strengths this time and finishing to good effect, but essentially left with a bit too much to do even in a strongly-run contest; in rear, still last over 1f out, ran on late, nearest at the finish."
"8th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: Reasonably solid form for the level, the winner finally getting off the mark having improved this season, while the runner-up was building on a fair effort from the time before, the race given substance by the timefigure. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect, giving plenty of early ground away after her rider opted to angle sharply right leaving the stalls; switched soon after start, held up, hung left but plugged on final 1f, never nearer, left poorly placed."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap run at a sound pace, the winner belatedly carrying his early-season improvement on all-weather back to turf, though fortunate on the day given the trouble the runner-up found. | [HORSE]: , beaten at odds-on from this mark last time, had to weave in and out looking for room and, despite a strong finish once in the clear late, he just ran out of time. He looked unlucky and remains a 4yo on the up."
"3rd of 7, fairly beaten | [RACE]: This had an open look to it and a close contest seemed likely as late as 1f out, the race messy to that point, with the field close against the rail, but the winner with a clear run on the outside soon settled matters. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect back in handicap company, caught behind a wall of horses from 2f out until inside the final 1f and then hit over the head with a rival's whip, but he was also left behind by the principals late on, undone by the combination of bad ground and racing in typically enthusiastic style; he could be the type to benefit from a gelding operation."
"7th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: This isn't a handicap from which to draw firm conclusions, the field staying towards the far rail in the straight and things getting very congested, most of the field meeting trouble at some point to one degree or another, the steady gallop just exacerbating matters and also placing the emphasis on speed, 3 of the first 4 home all stepping up in trip, Perfect Part, Eve's Boy and Gallant topping the list of those who looked unlucky on the day. | [HORSE]: was stuck behind horses and swamped on this handicap debut. He'll be well worth another chance."
"8th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: This looked competitive beforehand and the finish was compacted further because of the muddling tempo, Emperor Spirit able to dictate and just holding on with them in a heap in behind, those hold up not seen to best effect with Walking On Clouds arguably the most unfortunate, the form unlikely to prove solid. | [HORSE]: has bundles of ability but he doesn't help himself, again pulling hard. He ran into a number of dead ends in the straight with his rider accepting the situation in the final 100 yards. He can win a nice prize when things pan out favourably but he's one to tread carefully with."
"Won | [RACE]: A decidedly useful handicap that saw a couple of upwardly-mobile types fill the first 2 places, and both are likely to remain of interest; the gallop was fair at best. | [HORSE]: back down in trip after 8 weeks off, having been gelded during that break, and got back on the up; chased leader, settled better than last time (went with zest), loomed up 2f out, produced to lead soon after, tackled final 1f, kept going well; his Goodwood run aside his profile is most progressive and he'll remain of interest, either this backend or as a 4-y-o, possessing the scope to do better still next year (good-topped gelding)."
"4th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: This went the way of a progressive 3-y-o who appeals as one to keep on side for a while longer yet, the chasing bunch all held up in a race run to suit such tactics due to the headwind. | [HORSE]: would have been placed but her jockey dropped his rein inside the last and the filly lost momentum."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: The main talking point of this ordinary apprentice handicap was the inteference caused by the third in the straight, Revision hanging and badly hampering several of his rivals, chief among them the well-supported favourite, the overall form best treated with caution as a result. | [HORSE]: caused all the problems towards the inside, for which his jockey got a nine-day careless riding ban, so his third may not be reliable form."
"7th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A slightly disjointed-looking race from start to finish, with a smaller group of 3 spending most of the race away from the others after a couple had moved to join the bigger pack after 1f or so, with several changes of lead along the way to add to the muddling feel, the confidently-handled winner delivered last of all. | [HORSE]: shaped better than the distance beaten suggests, getting herself into the mix even in a higher grade, the extra 1f seemingly just beyond her; raced far side, in touch, not settle fully, effort 2f out, every chance over 1f out, effort flattened out."
"2nd of 5 | [RACE]: A controversial handicap decided in the stewards' room, the thriving favourite carrying Easter Icon right for most of the final 1f and little separating them at the line. | [HORSE]: is thriving but his inability to keep straight under pressure cost him another win; in touch, headway halfway, led 2f out, driven over 1f out, hung right from that point and bumped rival close home, just held on, demoted; will continue to give a good account."
"4th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A steady gallop coupled with a tailwind in the straight meant a prominent pitch was crucial in this handicap, the pair who pulled clear perhaps a shade flattered by the bare result as a consequence. | [HORSE]: without a tongue strap this time, was appreciably shorter in the betting than on recent starts but didn't really get the chance to show what hwe could do; held up, pushed along home turn, progress over 1f out, no extra close home, left poorly placed; is eligible for lesser races than this and back down to his last winning mark, so not one to write off."
"Won | [RACE]: A well-run affair that saw the first 3 come from the last 3 positions, the winner a recent scorer over hurdles, that one chased home by a consistent sort, with the third quite lightly raced, offering plenty of hope for the form at a similar level. | [HORSE]: a recent winner over hurdles, followed up back on the Flat from a much-reduced mark, with a tongue strap on for the first time in this sphere; dwelt, patiently ridden, smooth headway from 3f out, led well over 1f out, had plenty in hand; such a limp 2021 season means he'll still have handicapping scope even once reassessed for this, and is clearly back somewhere near the top of his game."
"7th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: A handicap in which the efforts of the pair who pulled a little way clear are worth viewing positively, the winner still on the up and the runner-up on a fair mark; the gallop picked up when Sophiesticate went on before halfway and it seemed a true test at the trip. | [HORSE]: pulled her way to the front and ensured this was truly run, albeit stopping quickly herself."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sprint handicap which developed towards the stand side, the first 2 bouncing back to form from much-reduced marks, the winner scoring quite readily on his first go at the trip. | [HORSE]: did well to finish as close as he did, having lost ground at the start when his blindfold was removed late. He made up a good amount of ground, but found himself with too much to do."
"12th of 15, well beaten | [RACE]: A good-quality and competitive handicap, the winner going through a fine spell but fortunate to add another win to his CV on the day, the next 3 home all shaping better than him for various reasons, with the runner-up in particular looking an unlucky loser; the gallop was nothing special. | [HORSE]: fared no better in first-time tongue strap; always behind; has made a low-key start for current yard and now has plenty to prove."
"2nd of 7 | [RACE]: The 3-y-os at the head of the betting served up a dramatic finish, Cool Legend firstly bumping the improving runner-up then carrying him right, just a head between them at the line and the result rightly overturned. | [HORSE]: in first-time tongue strap (cheekpieces left off this time), briefly got off the mark for the season upped in trip, seeming to benefit from a switch to positive tactics, though he failed to keep straight late on and lost the race in a stewards inquiry; made running, went at least 2 lengths clear early in straight, tackled entering final 1f, bumped runner-up/rider dropped whip soon after, edged right, just held on but demoted to second."
"3rd of 16, involved in finish | [RACE]: The 5f handicap which preceeded this race suggested that high draws had an advantage on the straight track at this meeting and that was hammered home by this result with them dominating the finish, the winning 3-y-o getting back on the up to get the better of one who has lots of good efforts under these conditions. | [HORSE]: has yet to score in 2022 but got back on track off a reduced mark, finding only the winner too strong late on the near side."
"14th of 14, well beaten | [RACE]: An evenly run contest that resulted in a tight finish but should still prove decent form for the level, with several of those that came to the fore likely to be of interest again in similar events. | [HORSE]: offered little after 8 months off and has failed to beat a rival on his last 3 outings now, a tack issue in the penultimate quarter of the race offering only partial mitigation on this occasion; led, jinked right halfway (rider briefly lost irons), headed 3f out, weakened quickly."
"8th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A useful handicap and though it was run at an ordinary tempo, it appeals as the sort of race to work out fairly well, the runner-up always well placed and bouncing back to form but picked off late on by one who continues to thrive; with the gallop as it was a couple of the closers can be upgraded, Tiger Crusade not seen to best effect and Strike Red catching the eye from right out the back. | [HORSE]: failed to repeat last effort but he'll be better off in a lower grade; slowly into stride, held up, pushed along 2f out, one paced."
"6th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: An above-average race for the grade, the pace strong and setting things up ideally for the thriving favourite, the second also enjoying a good run of late. | [HORSE]: in first-time blinkers, shaped as if back in form back at his ideal trip, having to do plenty to get to the lead from a wide draw. and he'll be of interest at this level when better berthed to attack; raced wide, soon led, raced freely, headed over 1f out, weakened last ½f; not one to write off."
"7th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: A tale of 2 handicap debutants on pre-race ratings and the market, but it wasn't a fair fight, the completely-unexposed Poker Face spreadeagling his rivals in the straight, destined for much bigger things. | [HORSE]: easy to back after 5 months off, won this contest last year by a wide margin but ran no sort of race for the second start in succession back on softer ground, his season having been most disappointing; in touch, pushed along 3f out, left behind well over 2f out."
"6th of 21, competitive | [RACE]: The sprint track at York has tended to offer a significant advantage to those drawn low this season, to the extent that jockeys were riding to mitigate that here, the field coming pretty much as one down the middle to far side which meant thie bias wasn't so pronounced and single-figure stalls filled only 2 of the first 13 places, trouble in running a factor for some of those drawn low, Secret Guest and The Green Man wiped out before halfway and things getting tight for others inside the final 1f, Strike Red already having put the race to bed at that point, bagging the valuable prize he'd threatened at several points this year. | [HORSE]: had made the frame in the last 2 runnings of this under similar conditons and wasn't disgraced considering this company is a bit too hot for him these days, no coincidence that his 2 uns this year have come when bossing 0-85 company; chased leader, pushed along before halfway, edged left over 1f out, not quicken."
"2nd of 11, competitive | [RACE]: Those on the front end probably did a bit too much too soon, but that shouldn't take anything away from the fast-improving winner, whose performance is supported by a good timefigure. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, took a step forward, suited by increase in trip; dwelt, mid-field, ridden under 3f out, headway over 1f out, kept on, no match for winner."
"4th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: A useful handicap dominated by a thriving sort, Doctor Khan Junior quickly setting his seal on the race when asked to go about his business, though the next 3 home all shaped well for varying reasons, the third in particular looking one to note. | [HORSE]: hadn't shown much on his last 2 starts but, fitted with first-time cheekpieces, shaped as if on the way back, not seen to best effect on several counts; hampered start, raced off the pace, short of room 2f out, headway when switched over 1f out, plugged on final 1f."
"3rd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: Handicap form to treat with some caution due to the pedestrian gallop, things developing into a sprint from 2f out with the one who was allowed to dictate emerging on top. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, after 9 weeks off, wasn't seen to best effect and is better judged on previous form/promise; slowly into stride, waited with, had to wait for gap over 2f out, shaken up under 2f out, ran on, conceded first run; remains with potential and can prove this opening mark to be a lenient one another day."
"4th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: A fair 3-y-o handicap dominated by the smaller group of low-drawn horses that raced far side, the winner making most, while the fourth shaped best of the rest. | [HORSE]: just behind MISS BRITAIN at Thirsk, deserves plenty of credit for winning the race on his side after a messy start and being drawn on the unfavoured flank. This was only his fifth outing and a race should be found."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: The second, third and fourth all arrived on the back of good efforts, and all had their chance in a fairly modestly-run race, but couldn't fend off a lightly-raced 3-y-o who picked his way between them and was value for a bit extra. | [HORSE]: didn't enjoy a trouble-free run and was only beaten half a length, but can't be classed as unlucky given how comfortably the favourite won. It was a solid run from him."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A basement-grade contest in which the winner soon had them well strung out, Pinjarra finally breaking his maiden after numerous tries. | [HORSE]: ridden with contrasting tactics down from a mile, did some strong late work only to find the bird had flown."
"5th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: This proved to be less competitive than it looked on paper, the near rail explored for the first time on the afternoon, the quartet that raced there taking the first 4 places, though only the first 2 showed their form, surprising in retrospect that none of the earlier races had developed on that part of the track, given the usual presumed advantage there on softer ground. | [HORSE]: wasn't in the same form as last time, though he raced on seemingly an unfavoured part of the track and is best excused the run; raced off the pace, shaken up halfway, challenged briefly 2f out, weakened final 1f."
"6th of 16, competitive | [RACE]: The leaders went off hard in this run-of-the-mill handicap, with the front pair coming from well back, the winner hanging and causing some trouble in behind when hitting the front, though he was well on top at the finish; the majority of the field raced down the centre, while the runner-up and one other stayed on the stand-side rail. | [HORSE]: wasn't in the same form as last time, though in fairness was pretty much the meat in the sandwich of the interference caused by the winner, albeit not really interrupting his momentum too much; mid-field, headway over 1f out, bumped inside final 1f, no extra late on."
"5th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A modest contest run at a steady pace, those ridden prominently at an advantage, and it's a race where a bit of progression went a long way, a newcomer in this sphere scoring comfortably. | [HORSE]: with hood applied upped further in trip, was again strong in the betting but not seen to best effect, left poorly placed and also meeting trouble; soon steadied, headway from over 2f out, not clear run last ½f, never landed a blow; we're yet to see the best of him and he's one to be interested in, especially when a stronger gallop looks to be on the cards."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that was run at a strong gallop, those drawn low going off too hard and setting it up for a pair of closers that opted for different paths, Garfield Shadow sneaking up the inner and just holding off one forced wider. | [HORSE]: maintained his unbeaten record on this on handicap/seasonal debut, unleashing a strong run against the far rail having looked to have plenty on turning for home. Suited by the step up to 6f, he's capable of better still and looks one for good-quality sprint handicaps this season."
"Won | [RACE]: A bunched finish to a borderline useful affair and the unexposed pair that headed the market can both be marked up having found trouble, Yorkshire doing especially well to force a dead-heat. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, stepped up on appreciably on reappearance run (yard currently in red-hot form) and looked rejuvenated by the return to firmer ground, though was probably fortunate to share the spoils given the trouble at Yorkshire found; soon steadied, switched after 1f, loomed up out wide 2f out, shaken up entering final 1f, led close home, joined post."
"4th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: These 3-y-os are lightly raced and all but one of them had had no more than one previous start in a handicap; they finished in a bit of a heap, the runner-up doing quite well in the circumstances, though the winner always seemed to have matters in hand. | [HORSE]: third of four over 1m2f at Salisbury on reappearance, showed improved form upped in trip, making his move from off a steady pace. He can progress again and is one to be with once faced with 1m6f or more, being related to a 2m winner, out of a mare who is a half-sister to St Leger runner-up Quiff."
"5th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A soundly-run handicap that played into the hands of the closers, Sayifyouwill enhancing her already excellent record on all-weather even further at the expense of one who was chasing a hat-trick; Lockdown shaped best of those up with pace while some of the closers weren't seen to best effect as they ran into trouble. | [HORSE]: did best of those who were ridden close to the good gallop, only dropping away inside the final half furlong. He'll be worth another go over this distance."
"3rd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A slow gallop meant these finished in a heap and the form as a whole is almost certainly dubious, the winner better positioned than the placed horses and getting first jump on them as a result. | [HORSE]: had won two of his last three and this was another fair effort under a penalty, perhaps just being caught in the wrong place as the dash for home began. His winning may not be done yet."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: This looked a good race on paper with interesting 3-y-os towards the head of the betting, as well as in-form sorts, and it should prove solid form, the older brigade predominantly coming to the fore with the reliable winner, a specialist at this course, edging out a last-time-scorer, that pair on the other wing to the fast-finishing Bopedro, whilst the hat-trick seeking Havana Blue was better than the result. | [HORSE]: back on softer ground, is one of the least exposed and ran well taking on his elders returned to 1m for the first time since a wide-margin winner on debut, caught towards the outer wing, though it was a typical story in terms of his exuberance, connections surely tempted to geld him now, this mark certainly not beyond him if he can channel his energy; held up, headway under pressure 2f out, hung left 1f out, kept on."
"5th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A fair handicap which saw the finish fought out by a couple that were popular in the betting, though the next pair in the market both lost their chance at the start which devalued the race to some extent. | [HORSE]: had won this race from 1 lb higher last year and came here in good form but lost all chance at the start, likely to bounce back quickly from this; very slowy away, in rear, pushed along over 1f out, late headway, left poorly placed; not one to write off."
"5th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A strong race for the grade, the odds-on winner not having everything in his favour this time and doing well to defy a double penalty at the expense of some quite well-treated sorts, the 7 that came a little way clear all likely to be of some interest again at this level. | [HORSE]: Racing Post Ratings assessment: the winner did well after blowing the start and was value for a bit extra."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: The leaders went off too hard in this amateur jockeys' handicap, setting things up for the closers, the winner getting a perfect run up the near-side rail. | [HORSE]: has been running over further so the strong pace was very much in his favour. He didn't enjoy quite as much fortune in the run as the winner, denied a clear passage when he needed it but keeping on at the finish."
"4th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A muddling contest in which the winner was seen to good effect, several in behind inconvenienced by the slow pace, including the runner-up who still had plenty to do from 2f out. | [HORSE]: after 8 months off, took a step forward making her all-weather/handicap debut, despite the steady gallop not suiting her even over this longer distance; mid-division, raced freely, rapid headway before halfway, remained prominent, shaken up around 2f out, challenged final 1f, no extra final 50 yds; open to further improvement with this run behind her."
"4th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: An open-looking handicap on paper, the first 3 doing well to pull clear in the straight, though the placed pair held first and second for much of the way and may have been at an advantage in a race where they pottered along until 4f out. | [HORSE]: shaped encouragingly after 5 months off, likely to prove fully effective at the trip another day, not ideally placed to land a blow and spared a hard race; held up, effort entering straight, headway 1f out, considerately handled, never on terms; likely to be back to his best with a run under his belt."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap in which the gallop seemed sound but it still proved hard to get involved from off the pace, something that reflects well on Laser Guided, who did well to force a dead heat in the circumstances. | [HORSE]: making handicap/turf debut, showed much improved form to open his account, only getting a share of the spoils on the night but shaping best, coming from further back than the other pair with whom he pulled a little way clear; dwelt, mid-field, smooth headway around 3f out, loomed up 2f out, effort soon after, edged ahead over 1f out, headed final 100 yds, kept on well and forced a dead heat; better to come and will remain of interest."
"2nd of 26, involved in finish | [RACE]: The straight course has seemed very fair all week so far, the groundstaff deserving plenty of plaudits for the state of the surface given the uncertain forecast and any advantage in the bigger fields has tended to be pace related, that certainly appearing the case here, the Wathnan-owned Make Me King leading the group of those drawn 17 or higher at a tempo that brought out the very best in one of the same owners' recent purchases, English Oak justifying favouritism in the style that you rarely see in these high-level events, looking on his way to pattern company; there are some in behind that can be marked up over the bare result, Carrytheone meeting significant interference and shaping clear second best while in the unfavoured groups, perennial eye-catcher Summerghand did best of those that raced centre-to-far side, though unable to reel back the pair that raced closest to the far rail. | [HORSE]: has been performing consistently well over sprint trips and he rattled home once switched to earn another placing on this first try over 7f. He could be open to further improvement at the trip."
"4th of 21, involved in finish | [RACE]: What promised to be a highly-competitive handicap was essentially blown apart by one that had shaped very well here at the Dante Meeting, Mums Tipple ensuring the pace was brisk from the off but never really looking like getting reeled in, nothing able to get involved from behind, including the majority of his main market rivals. | [HORSE]: was one of the least exposed and ran up to best on just his second ever turf start, though it wasn't hard to tell why connections have reached for headgear; mid-division, took strong hold, in touch when hung right approaching final 1f, kept on."
"5th of 10, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that looks reasonable enough form for the grade, the second and the fifth in particular worth viewing positively; the pace was sensible in rain-softened conditions. | [HORSE]: after 10 weeks off, shaped with some encouragement, the last off the bridle but unable to sustain an effort having pulled reasonably hard early on; held up, raced freely, headway out wide 2f out, hung right over 1f out, never a threat; he's one to keep an eye on."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade contest which proved a re-run of a race that took place here back in July, the winner carrying on his good year by again stealing a march on the well-treated but less straightforward runner-up. | [HORSE]: , 3lb better off with ARLECCHINO'S GIFT for 1.25l from their meeting over C&D in July, did well to get as close as he did, finding himself with too much to do after meeting interference at the start. His turn is surely coming."
"Won | [RACE]: This unfolded into a 2f dash, those who raced on the speed unsurprisingly coming firmly to the fore, the winner deserving extra credit having overcome the run of the race. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, took a small step forward to get off the mark, doing well under the circumstances; patiently ridden, driven 2f out, good progress 1f out, led final 50 yds, overcame pace bias; still relatively unexposed and one to bear in mind on follow up bid."
"Won | [RACE]: Fairly useful form from the first 2 in this modestly-run 3-yo handicap, the runner-up not getting the best of runs due to the marked wandering of the winner, but the result was the correct one, Dark Trooper still comfortably on top despite his antics. | [HORSE]: gelded since last seen, was well backed and showed improved form to get off the mark with more in hand than the bare margin suggests switched to all-weather after 3 months off, his antics off the bridle put down to greenness for now, wandering badly both ways but still enough ahead of his mark to see out the step up in trip well; mid-field, headway over 2f out, produced to lead over 1f out, wandered badly, kept on final 1f, had plenty in hand; will remain of plenty of interest."
"2nd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary contest, though the winner is at least relatively unexposed, while there was drama a bit further back as the rider of St Andrew's Castle struggled to ride a finish having suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, ran well but rather conspired to throw things away late on, seeming to think he'd done enough once hitting the front and allowing the winner to nab him late on; mid-field, switched over 2f out, headway over 1f out, led well inside final 1f, idled and headed dying strides, worried out of it."
"10th of 16, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A highly-competitive handicap to conclude 5 days at the track, one of the roughest races of the week, with plenty meeting trouble, but a well-run affair, the principals all coming from mid-field or further back, the winner having just his second handicap start, two 3-y-os chasing him home, the form worth viewing positively, despite the stated issues with the run of the race. | [HORSE]: wasn't disgraced after 4 months off, a bit too fresh early and not having a clear run either, likely to step up on this; in touch, not settle fully, headway 3f out, bumped 2f out, ridden, hung right over 1f out, one paced."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Surely a strong piece of form, a pair of prolific recent winners finishing either side of an unexposed one, the gaps between them - as well as back to the rest - reflective of an end-to-end gallop. | [HORSE]: after 7 weeks off, improved again switched to a handicap, lots to like about both the way he went through the race and how he stuck at it even when the progressive winner came past; in touch, loomed up 3f out, went on soon after, headed entering final 1f, stuck to task, pulled clear of remainder; well up to winning something similar from a mark in the mid-80s."
"3rd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: The near rail was the place to be at the last meeting here and it was certainly no negative once more as Sterling Knight followed up last month's C&D success, on the right part of the track but his superiority was clear and he'd have won by further but for his late antics; Air Raid, Snash and Emperor Spirit initially raced a bit wider before joining the others before halfway, Punchbowl Flyer setting a strong gallop which played into the hands of the closers in these conditions. | [HORSE]: winner of a soft-ground C&D novice a year ago, came into this on the back of a close second at Salisbury. She ran another good race and would have finished a bit closer but for being compromised by the winner's wayward path in the latter stages. She enjoys cut and may be able to win something similar soon."
"11th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: The performance of the never-nearer fourth was the most notable aspect of an otherwise humdrum nursery with an off-puttingly bunched finish. | [HORSE]: looked less tricky after 8 weeks off but clearly hasn't inherited the family's ability and, worse still, she's been given an extremely stiff opening mark; waited with, pushed along straight, brief headway over 1f out, not sustain effort."
"6th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: This can hardly be described as a strong race for the grade, run at a steady tempo, but the winner is very much going the right way and followed up last week's win with a bit to spare, getting to the better-positioned second 1f out. | [HORSE]: in a change of headgear, is proving consistent rather than progressive, though she was a little better than the result this time; mid-division, stumbled after 2f, shuffled back well over 1f out, kept on final 1f."
"3rd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sprint handicap that saw a useful performance from the back-to-form winner, though he may well have been pushed close by the third had that one got a clearer passage. | [HORSE]: back down in grade, wasn't seen to best effect, likely to have pushed the winner close had she got out sooner; in touch, not clear run over 1f out, switched inside final 1f, kept on."
"6th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: With one of only a couple of interesting sorts on show not seen to anything like best effect, it's probably best to treat this form with caution for all the winner did it in impressive fashion. | [HORSE]: is easily excused this and better judged on his Doncaster form, hampered and losing his footing when staying on, spared a hard race. He relishes cut in the ground but it's too early to say he needs it to be fully effective."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A well-run handicap but it unfolded in similar fashion to the opening race with those racing close up favoured, the first 2 never far away and the pair that chased them home from much further back remain of greater interest for future engagements. | [HORSE]: back in a tongue strap, can have a line put through this run; mid-field, hampered after 2f, shuffled back, no chance after."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap which produced a 1-2 for Mick Appleby, Finery coming from off the pace to enhance an already superb C&D record. | [HORSE]: was very well backed into favouritism and bounced back to form, a tardy start leaving him with a mountain to climb; missed the break, soon behind, smooth progress from 3f out, headway when hampered early in straight, kept on well inside final 1f; he's one to be interested in from this sort of mark."
"6th of 20, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A very competitive affair dominated by the younger brigade with the very progressive held-up winner doing well to run down one who’d travelled strongly and kicked clear, his effort all the more creditworthy given those up with the pace throughout filled the next four places home. | [HORSE]: , a dual winner over 7f here, managed to get himself into a challenging position but couldn't capitalise. This trip just appears to stretch him and he is still 6lb above his last winning mark."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A valuable handicap that was a bit lacking in terms of both quantity and quality - the topweights in a single-figure field running off a mark 13 lb below the ceiling for the race - yet it still looks form worth following among the principals, plenty to like about the efforts of the first 3, the field a good one on looks; the runners kept to the stand rail in the straight. | [HORSE]: well placed to win at Redcar, faced tougher opposition, back against his own age group and acquitted himself very well, clear of the rest behind a totally unexposed one; tracked pace, took keen hold, led 2f out, shaken up after, ridden final 1f, headed last ½f; he'll continue to give a good account."
"Won | [RACE]: A well-run contest, the well-treated Power of Darkness blowing the race apart under an aggressive front-running ride and narrowly holding on from fast-finishing runner-up, who was arguably unlucky the way things developed. | [HORSE]: got an aggressive ride out in front and found the line coming just in time. He hadn't set out to make all in any of his previous 32 outings, so these new tactics evidently worked a treat and returning cheekpieces also played a part inside the final furlong. The 8yo is also now 4-4 at this venue and had dropped 20lb since resuming in 2023."
"5th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modest contest and it proved muddling, the winner having the run of things from the front. | [HORSE]: is a long-standing maiden but shaped better than previously after just 4 days off; dwelt, held up, headway when no room from 2f out, not quicken when in clear, not unduly punished, would have benefited from a stronger gallop."
"Won | [RACE]: A decent 3-y-o handicap that should prove solid form, the field racing in one group centre to stand side, with the much-improved winner doing it convincingly after the front-running favourite had set a strong gallop; those drawn in the highest stalls appeared at something of a disadvantage. | [HORSE]: quite highly tried after winning on debut as a juvenile, seemed to benefit from both gelding/breathing operations in the 9 months he'd been away and showed much improved form on handicap debut, proving strong at the finish; touch, switched 2f out, headway over 1f out, led inside final 1f, kept on well; there could well be even more to come."
"6th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: Some fierce fractions set by Kracking, with Masqool dragged into doing too much in pursuit, and it was only the winner who truly coped with such an exacting examination, most of the rest showing a foible of some sort or other. | [HORSE]: went off at his customary 7f/1m pace and had no chance of lasting out over this longer trip; soon led and raced clear with one other, typically took strong hold, headed over 2f out, weakened, went off too hard."
"2nd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap that rather fell apart, the 2 market leaders the first beaten and nothing ever looked likely to lay a glove on the winner who had the race in safe keeping a long way out. | [HORSE]: tried in a visor, was flattered to finish as close as he did to the winner, but there was enough here to suggest a race can be found."
"4th of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: Handicap form to treat with some caution due to the pedestrian gallop, things developing into a sprint from 2f out with the one who was allowed to dictate emerging on top. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect; slowly into stride, in touch, effort around 2f out, not quicken, not ideally placed in a race that developed into a sprint."
"Won | [RACE]: A competitive handicap on paper but it resulted in an easy winner, Tammani the only one to head far side and winning comfortably while the others near side were always well grouped and battled it out for the minor honours; the pace was modest. | [HORSE]: comfortably got off the mark for this yard after 8 days off, this performance not without reason given how he'd shaped a couple of starts back, but the fact he won so easily having been the only one to race far side suggests he was also in the right place; awkward leaving stalls, switched to race far side, prominent, pushed along 2f out, led 1f out, drew clear final 1f, won easily, big positional advantage."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap taken by one who's relatively low mileage for a sprinter, American Affair always up there, while the runner-up came from much further back, the fourth not seen to best effect on the back of a troubled trip. | [HORSE]: had the inside stall, but a slow start negated that advantage. She was always playing catch-up thereafter, meeting some traffic problems before finishing her race quite well."
"4th of 4, well beaten | [RACE]: A convincing success for the gambled-on Uncle Dick, who was well suited by how things developed, coming from last to first in a strongly-run race. | [HORSE]: seems a more attractive proposition on all-weather but can have a line put through this run, ridden too aggressively; forced pace, kicked on halfway, headed entering final 1f, no extra."
"15th of 23, well beaten | [RACE]: This was just the fifth ever running of this handicap and only the second on the straight course; the key feature of this year’s renewal was a pronounced track bias, with those in the near side group holding a significant advantage given they were already appreciably ahead of their far side counterparts well before halfway, the imbalance obviously rendering the race less competitive, with only one runner from the far side group managing to finish in the top half of the field; that said, the winner’s performance was still well up to standard in the context of the race’s short history, and the overall time compared favourably with the preceding Hunt Cup. | [HORSE]: came here in form but ran below par."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A shock winner, but a typical C&D handicap in many ways, a prominent position the box seat and the closers not seen to best effect, especially Abduction having tried to burrow through up the inner. | [HORSE]: finds it difficult to get his head in front, but is undoubtedly in top form at present, giving the impression he'd have put down a serious challenge to the winner had he got a clear run; steadied at the start, raced off the pace, headway when no room on rail over 2f out, switched over 1f out, stayed on, finished with running left."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap that went to one who has dropped to a career-low mark, another couple on handy marks also making the frame. | [HORSE]: who has done most of his winning over the straight mile at Newcastle, can be considered unfortunate, finishing off with a rare rattle down the outer after having to be switched away from the far rail at the two-furlong pole. He sits on his last winning mark."
"3rd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A pair of duelling leaders went off hard in this fairly useful sprint and rather set things up for those positioned just a little further back, Muker swooping last of all to get off the mark for the season. | [HORSE]: ran his best race of the season and probably would have held on for longer had he not hurdled a football just inside the final furlong."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modest contest in which those that made their effort more towards the stands side dominated the finish, the temperamental winner coming from last to first. | [HORSE]: was well supported and ran a big race in a change of headgear, but three came from off the pace to beat him. They had the benefit of the stands' rail while he stayed up the centre, so this effort can be marked up."
"5th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A prominent pitch proved crucial in this low-grade handicap, though it was the market leaders who fought out a head-bobbing finish, with the fifth shaping best of those ridden with restraint. | [HORSE]: who won a division of this race last year, shaped as if back in form despite not being ideally placed; dwelt, in rear, effort out wide entering straight, headway over 1f out, stayed on, not unduly punished."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A pair of duelling leaders set up this modest handicap for one returning from a break to swoop from the rear, with solid efforts from the placed horses, both of whom raced much closer to the strong pace. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, ran well in first-time cheekpieces, particularly as he was the first to challenge the duelling leaders; chased leaders, led over 1f out, hung right, headed well inside final 1f, lost second late on."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Suspect form, the favourite unseating leaving the stalls while another refused to race, the loose horse also proving an obstacle at stages, and the first 4 all finished in a heap. | [HORSE]: got back on track with a good effort with cheekpieces reapplied; prominent, not clear run behind loose horse 2f out, headway to lead 1f out, headed final 1f, no extra close home."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful 3-y-o handicap to view in quite a positive light, Mogok Valley running out a comfortable winner from a couple who took a step forward making their debut in this sphere. | [HORSE]: ran well making handicap debut, unlucky not to finish closer; mid-field, headway when short of room over 1f out, shuffled back briefly, driven final 1f, kept on; will remain of interest."
"6th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive 3-y-o handicap, all bar 2 of them making the first 3 on their previous start, so scope for it working out better than the majority of races that feature such a blanket finish, less than half a length separating the first 5. | [HORSE]: back up to 6f, can have her performance marked up as she missed the break, was wide off the final bend and ended up nearer the stands' rail. Despite all that she wasn't beaten far."
"Won | [RACE]: A competitive handicap and it's form that should work out well, the front pair both still going the right way, in particular the prolific winner. | [HORSE]: is most progressive and racked up another win to improve upon what is already an impressive strike rate, justifying market confidence and opening up more options with regards trip; in touch, travelled fluently, headway 2f out, shaken up approaching final 1f, stayed on to lead final 50 yds; again left the impression there was a fair bit left in the tank at the line and his style of racing is likely to keep him ahead of the handicapper for a while longer yet."
"5th of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: An apprentice contest in which several weren't seen to best effect due to interference suffered and/or hanging off a true line under pressure, though Expert Witness still deserves credit both for her consistency and for coming from last to first in the closing stages. | [HORSE]: shaped better than the bare result, though this isn't the first time she's shown a tendency to go left under pressure; soon steadied, travelled well, headway 3f out, shaken up over 2f out, hung left, switched approaching final 1f, keeping on when short of room last ½f, finished with running left."
"7th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful and competitive sprint handicap that should prove solid form despite track position playing a key role, the field racing towards the far side with the finish dominated by those who raced prominently towards the rail. | [HORSE]: retried in headgear, shaped as if back in form, racing further away from the rail than all those who beat him; chased leaders, travelled well, challenged under 2f out, weakened final 100 yds."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Mostly very known quantities in this handicap, but the first 2 had both run well at this track recently; the first 4 home occupied the first 4 positions throughout. | [HORSE]: having only his sixth outing, had the cheekpieces back on and travelled well, but he was done few favours by the hanging In The Breeze up the home straight and having got around that rival, was left with too much to do. His record around here reads 2122."
"Won | [RACE]: A well-run contest that played into the hands of those held up off the early gallop, the runner-up producing by far his best effort on British shores but unable to claw back an enigmatic sort well on his way to becoming a course specialist. | [HORSE]: turned out again quickly, proved at least as good as ever to resume winning ways and register his second C&D success this month (fourth course win overall), again well suited by the way the race developed; dwelt, raced off the pace, headway from 3f out, ridden over 1f out, led final 1f, kept going well; he's got a decent strike rate for one so quirky, but he'll have no further opportunities at this track until 2025 and the percentage call will be to take him on next time."
"4th of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: Improvement from the all-the-way winner but the wide margin of victory owed plenty to nothing else running much of a race. | [HORSE]: is better than this but looked a hard ride and probably isn't to be trusted; dwelt, held up, lost place when hung badly left end of back straight, progress over 3f out, driven over 2f out, no further impression."
"4th of 15, fairly beaten | [RACE]: This looked a typically competitive springtime 3-y-o handicap here beforehand, and it's sure to throw up its share of winners in the coming weeks, but in the event it proved one sided, Tranquil Night taking this in the style of a smart prospect; the gallop was fair and, though initially the field fanned out across the course, by the end the main action was centre-to-near side, Tylos worst placed of the principals in that regard, caught out on the far flank. | [HORSE]: after 11 weeks off, was back up markedly in grade but confirmed the improvement shown last time; led, went with enthusiasm, headed over 1f out, ran on; she'll be at least as effective back at 7f if connections opt to persevere with these tactics."
"3rd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A truly one-sided apprentice handicap, The Cola Kid not having to come out of second gear back sprinting to notch a fifth career success. | [HORSE]: made much of the running, but away from what looked to be the favoured stands' rail, and when she began to weaken she hung right. As her jockey failed to correct the drift, he was handed a four-day careless riding ban."
"Won | [RACE]: An exciting finish to an ordinary affair that mainly set up for those from mid-field and further back, the returning Buy The Dip faring best of those that raced on the speed. | [HORSE]: on toes beforehand (wore red hood), had slipped to last winning mark and fared much better than he had in this race last year, proving just about as good as ever, albeit getting his ideal scenario and very much suited by how it developed, his rider sensibly resorting to mainly hand riding on a temperamental character; slowly into stride, in rear, switched soon after start, headway under pressure over 2f out, challenged entering final 1f, edged ahead final 100 yds; far from certain to be in the same mood next time."
"5th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: Decent-looking form for the grade, the winner progressive and leading home a trio of in-form and/or well-treated sorts that had all met at least some form of trouble in the straight. | [HORSE]: sat too close to a good gallop and didn't get home, but he did best of the pace horses and can be given another chance."
"2nd of 27, involved in finish | [RACE]: The third running of this competitive 3-y-o handicap produced the biggest field yet, and it was a race that provided trainer Harry Eustace with his first Royal Ascot winner from his very first runner, Latin Lover never too far away and value for another improved effort; the main body of the field raced down the centre, the smaller near-side group merging with them around halfway, hard to detect any significant bias, though those drawn very low may have been a touch disadvantaged, with a couple of hard-luck stories down the field involving Korker and Tippy Toes. | [HORSE]: not disgraced in plenty of Group races as a juvenile, came into this off a solid reappearance effort at Chester and probably ran in line with her best in defeat."
"6th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A sight very rarely seen in a sprint handicap, the unexposed and well-backed favourite not needing to come off the bridle to dispatch a field that wasn't devoid of in-form sorts, Altmore very much going places at a rate of knots. | [HORSE]: arrived in the form of her life but was easy to back and undone by a rise in the weights; in touch, ridden under 2f out, no extra entering final 1f."
"4th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A lack of depth for the grade but a useful handicap nevertheless, the winner in top form while the runner-up seems sure to go one better before long, the fourth one to be interested in too. | [HORSE]: ran about as well as he ever has on turf, unlucky not to have at least finished closer still too; in rear, travelled better than most, headway when short of room under 2f out, lost momentum at crucial stage, switched approaching final 1f, kept on, finished with running left; he suddenly looks capable of winning again on turf from this sort of mark."
"5th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steady gallop resulted in a bunched finish and this isn't form to take at face value, the winner better placed than anything else to make the frame, whilst further back Northern Cracksman endured a luckless passage and would surely have gone close granted a fair shake of the dice. | [HORSE]: returned to some form having been well positioned, though was another involved in some bumping."
"7th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A really strong handicap on paper, 5 of them having already won at least one handicap this season and several other interesting ones too, and there seems little reason not to take a positive view in spite of a slower gallop than might have been expected, the second and fourth both doing well to get as close as they did in the circumstances. | [HORSE]: easy to back after 7 weeks off, found it tougher in pursuit of the hat-trick but this was a stronger race and the way it developed meant it was always likely to be hard for him to get involved from his position; missed the break, held up, not settle fully, still plenty to do 2f out, late headway, left poorly placed."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: Borderline smart form by the winner of this handicap, who looked better than ever, the chasing pack led home by another thriving sort; the gallop was fair but, as is often the case around here, it still proved tricky to get involved from right out the back. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, found only one too good for the third time in 4 starts and looks better than ever; mid-field, travelled fluently, shaken up under 2f out, kept on well final 1f but unable to peg back one to whom he conceded first run; he's had quite a light campaign and is very much one to look out for this backend, especially when conditions are testing."
"Won | [RACE]: The pair who raced on the far side had this to themselves from a long way out and it ultimately wasn't much of a match between them. | [HORSE]: seemingly proved better than ever as he resumed winning ways, though he's perhaps not so good as this made him look, seen to maximum effect under a good ride; raced far side, soon led, ridden 2f out, went clear approaching final 1f, won easily."
"Won | [RACE]: The result of this low-grade sprint looked unlikely at halfway, but with the leaders going off quite hard, Spirit In My Soul came through with a good run from the rear and was ultimately well on top. | [HORSE]: who made a winning stable debut in first-time blinkers at Redcar in June, picked up strongly to score in an authoritative manner. This was by no means a strong Class 6 contest, but the performance can be marked up given the fact that that she was slowly into stride and flat out at halfway. She's handicapped to do further damage at this level and a seventh furlong should be within range."
"4th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: Plenty weren't seen to best effect in a modestly-run affair in which space was at a premium in the straight, the prominently-ridden favourite getting first run on a trio who are on handy marks. | [HORSE]: has fallen a long way in the weights and turned in his best effort of the season, doing well under the circumstances in fact and one to be interested in again suddenly; dwelt, waited with, going well when not clear run from 3f out, switched over 1f out, ran on."
"8th of 27, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A typically strong running of the Buckingham Palace, the meeting all the better for its reintroduction in 2020, but for the third year in a row it was dominated by those drawn high, the action unfolding right up the near rail, much like in the Britannia over an hour earlier, the winner seen to something like maximum effect for all this Group-class effort has foundation, felt good enough to contest the Jersey at this meeting last year and one of a number to reap the benefit of a switch from the retired Sir Michael Stoute into a new yard this year. | [HORSE]: still has to prove himself so good on turf (improved to win 3 times on all-weather over the winter), but there was encouragement in this that he might another day; held up, travelled better than most, shaken up 2f out, ran on, nearest at the finish; he's at least as effective at 1m."
"3rd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap in which one of the fancied runners flopped, but the winner had been knocking on the door and outstayed Gallant Lion, who eventually faded into third having raced inefficiently, while the third looks a thorough stayer and couldn't get going in time. | [HORSE]: ran well in first-time cheekpieces and back on all-weather but was inefficient in places, trapped very wide and not settling, so didn't quite see out the step up to 2m, but he's unraced at 1¾m and a slight drop back in trip should prove ideal; raced wide, in touch, raced freely, headway circuit out, led 3f out, joined 1f out, headed last ½f, weakened."
"6th of 7, competitive | [RACE]: Most of these are less than straightforward or if, being kind, still green, though the winner showed signs he's maturing and was well on top come the line. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, was unable to adopt front running tactics having been slowly away and was below his best form, again taking a real grip early; slowly into stride, raced off the pace, took strong hold, brief headway over 1f out, carried head bit awkwardly, never dangerous; he's clearly not straightforward."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap for older horses and it was the runner-up who shaped best, Arkenstaar likely to have won had the gaps come sooner. | [HORSE]: whose form last time has worked out well, was unlucky not to follow up, his concession of first run to the winner proving crucial; in touch, had to wait for gap over 2f out, switched and got gap over 1f out, kept on well final 1f, just failed, pulled clear of remainder; is back in the groove now and should continue to give a good account from his reduced mark."
"2nd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful nursery in which Brave Emperor showed plenty of improvement coming back from a break, though his task was made easier on the day by the runner-up doing so much wrong. | [HORSE]: up in trip on AW debut, found one stronger for the fourth time in succession. However, given he was slowly away and keen early before having to make his challenge wide off the final bend, it's fair to acknowledge that things didn't go to plan. Nevertheless, a weak finishing effort suggests that this seventh furlong was a shade too far."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: An eventful low-grade handicap; it was truly run and almost saw a miraculous win for Racing Demon who lost many lengths at the start after almost refusing to race yet managed to get firmly into contention inside the final 1f. | [HORSE]: ran a remarkable race, almost getting there despite losing many lengths through his reluctance to start, in doing so showing what a risky proposition he is; virtually refused to race, in rear, pushed along 3f out, headway over 1f out, hung right, challenged final 1f, kept on."
"17th of 17, well beaten | [RACE]: A big field but just a standard handicap for the grade, the field splitting into 2 groups before merging over 2f out, the winner possibly advantaged by having the stand-side rail to run against, while the runner-up up had to forfeit ground by switching towards the centre to make his challenge and can be rated a touch unlucky. | [HORSE]: ran poorly after 4 months off, also reported to have lost a shoe for the second successive time; raced centre, prominent, hung right, folded from 2f out."
"6th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: Little to separate the front 3 in this basement-grade sprint, Bernie The Bear notching a third win from his last 6 starts on all-weather, deserving extra credit for being up with the strong pace throughout, while the fourth would likely have gone close without suffering interference. | [HORSE]: possibly needed the run after 5 months off; in rear, took keen hold, pushed along over 2f out, switched home turn, bumped soon after, headway when edged left inside final 1f, hampered rival soon after (jockey suspended for 2 days for careless riding), never on terms."
"2nd of 15, involved in finish | [RACE]: A high-end event that wasn't short of competitiveness, though was of unexposed sorts, the stable-switching runner-up a notable exception as he came out on the wrong side of a tight finish with one that's better than ever, the pair a little way clear; it was a soundly-run affair and low draws came to the fore, those in the frame dawn 5 or below, the fast-finishing Fantastic Fox best of those drawn high, there was some trouble in behind, too, though it had little bearing on the result in truth. | [HORSE]: 3-6 in France for previous connections, ran a fine race on his debut for his new yard, travelling just as well as the winner but possibly at a disadvantage in having to challenge wider out while the winner had the benefit of the inside rail throughout. There was little between them at the line anyway. He holds an entry in the Hunt Cup."
"Won | [RACE]: The headwind was at its strongest by this stage of the card and it typically favoured those held up, the pair that headed the betting racing on the outer flank and faring much better than the result suggests. | [HORSE]: wasted no time getting back to form to record a second victory over C&D from just a handful of starts for current yard, albeit seen to maximum effect, continuing the theme on the card of winners coming from the rear after finding plenty of cover from the headwind; broke on terms for a change, held up, smooth progress 2f out, driven 1f out, led last ½f, pushed out; suited by the way the race developed; circumstances unlikely to be so favourable next time."
"Won | [RACE]: Something of a messy affair but form that makes sense nevertheless, a game 3-y-o edging out a pair with recent victories to their name, a consistent sort completing the frame. | [HORSE]: after 10 weeks off, doubled his career tally with a most determined effort, suffering interference for most of the last 2f but battling admirably; mid-division, headway when bumped 2f out, carried left over 1f out, carried left again inside final 1f, stayed on to lead final 50 yds, well on top finish."
"6th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap that looks a pretty good piece of form, the front pair taking steps forward and chased home by one who has a rock-solid profile in this type of race, their efforts underpinned by the timefigure. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, wasn't disgraced; mid-field, outpaced 3f out, late headway; will prove suited by a return to 1¼m, but the main point with her is that she needs some respite from the handicapper."
"6th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: An end-to-end gallop resulted in a thorough test and a most likeable pair were the only ones who really stood up to it, the runner-up one of 4 last-time-out winners. | [HORSE]: up 7lb and up in grade, had shown improved form on his two previous starts but proved disappointing on ground the official time suggested was more heavy than soft. He'll likely do better back on less-testing ground."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap which looked as though the consistent Electric Bass had got off the mark by lunging late to grab a share of the spoils on the line, but he'd edged right in the process and impeded Maywedance, who was awarded the outright success. | [HORSE]: went even closer to to getting off the mark, improving for the slightly longer trip and joining Maywedance on the line only to lose his share of the win in the stewards' room; prominent, raced freely, pushed along 3f out, challenged over 1f out, hung right and impeded winner, kept on, upsides post, demoted; should remain competitive."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A race shaped by an overly-strong pace, the front 2 coming from rear out wide to pick up a group who'd been racing for about 2f already. | [HORSE]: had his winning run ended from another 4 lb higher but remains in good form; handy, travelled fluently, loomed up straight, every chance from 2f out, no extra only close home, did best of those ridden close to pace."
"6th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: Still a big field for this track, despite the withdrawal of those drawn in 15 and 16 and it was run at a sound gallop, Evocative Spark looking the likely winner for a long way but run down by a late closer than got a clearer run than some, Truely Aclaimed unlucky while Grifter was value for finishing closer, the form appealing as likely to work out quite well. | [HORSE]: shaped as if retaining all ability after 6 months off, is better than could show here; slowly into stride, held up, ridden when forced wide early in straight, plugged on; a lengthy gelding with scope, his best days should still be ahead of him."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Stopnsearch was subsequently demoted | [HORSE]: again shaped well and might well have won but for late interference after just 3 days off, the stewards promoting him to second; close up, lost place 4f out, ridden entering straight, stayed on, every chance when snatched up/badly hampered close home, eased off."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap, especially with the well-in favourite not quite meeting expectations; the main feature was a strong gallop and things got a bit messy in the straight as the pacesetters weakened, the front pair and the fourth making their efforts wide and avoiding the scrimmaging on their inside. | [HORSE]: ran better than for a while, suited by the drop in grade and being held up in a strongly-run race; raced off the pace, headway out wide under 2f out, briefly looked a bit hesitant final 1f but kept on, never nearer."
"5th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: There was no great pace on, but that didn't stop the hold-up horses getting involved, the winner totally unexposed and seeing off one that is back down to his last winning mark. | [HORSE]: was up in grade and ran a strange race for one stepping back up in trip, hitting a flat spot and totally losing his pitch, then not getting a clear run at it when getting rolling; mid-field, outpaced 3f out, lost place over 2f out, keeping on when short of room 1f out, plugged on."
"10th of 18, well beaten | [RACE]: Not as competitive as it might have been due to a marked draw bias, the larger group of high-drawn horses that stayed near side never on terms with the smaller centre-to-far-side group. | [HORSE]: found run of good form coming to a halt, but had his draw/track position as an excuse; held up, made little impression."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Solid handicap form, a couple of 4-y-os who are right at the top of their game finishing first and third and split by one who has tumbled down the weights, Helm Rock likely to have got up had the gaps come a shade sooner. | [HORSE]: has been given a big chance by the handicapper and ran one of this season's better races, looking unlucky not to win; dwelt, raced freely out wide in mid-field, lost place halfway, pushed along around 2f out, had to wait for gap, in the clear approaching final 1f, kept on well, just failed; he could do with brushing up on his starts, but he's clearly back in the sort of form that can see him end his losing run."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful handicap, but one where tactics played a part, the gallop only picking up around halfway when the rider of free-going Eagle Day grasped the nettle, the principals all in a heap with those ridden prominently at an advantage. | [HORSE]: bounced back to form after a spell in the doldrums, first-time cheekpieces the obvious place to start when looking for a catalyst; mid-field, came wide entering straight, headway when hung left over 1f out, stayed on, nearest at the finish; came from further back than the pair who beat him, but didn't look altogether straightforward so it remains to be seen if headgear continues to have a positive effect."
"5th of 15, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A few lightly-raced ones from good yards in a low-quality event but the main feature of it was instead the overly-strong gallop ensured by the market leaders that paved the way for a trio from the second or third waves to pick up the pieces and pull clear. | [HORSE]: failed to justify support, the side effects of an overly-strong pace possibly even flattering him; pushed along soon after start, off pace, labouring badly around 4f out, merely closed up late."
"5th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: This had looked competitive beforehand but it proved anything but, the winner in a different league to his rivals to make it 3 wins from his last 4 starts. | [HORSE]: was sent off a warm favourite back up in trip but proved to be a disappointment making her turf debut, connections offering the excuse that she was unsuited by the undulating nature of the track; held up, not settle fully, headway when switched 2f out, keeping on when carried left over 1f out, plugged on inside final 1f."
"23rd of 23, well beaten | [RACE]: This was just the fifth ever running of this handicap and only the second on the straight course; the key feature of this year’s renewal was a pronounced track bias, with those in the near side group holding a significant advantage given they were already appreciably ahead of their far side counterparts well before halfway, the imbalance obviously rendering the race less competitive, with only one runner from the far side group managing to finish in the top half of the field; that said, the winner’s performance was still well up to standard in the context of the race’s short history, and the overall time compared favourably with the preceding Hunt Cup. | [HORSE]: was on the wrong side and could never get competitive."
"8th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A weak contest won a shade readily by the least-exposed runner in the field. | [HORSE]: seemed reluctant to start and is of little interest, soon getting in touch with the rest in a steadily-run race but readily left behind 2f out."
"3rd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: Not much pace on in this handicap with the runner-up making most, but picked off by one returning to form having dropped in the weights; one or 2 of the beaten horses were better than the bare form, Mr Trick and Rebecca's Girl meeting interference while Concert Boy was nearest at the finish having had a remarkable amount of ground to make up. | [HORSE]: is down to a career-low mark these days and again shaped well, enough in this to suggest his turn is near; prominent, going well when forced to switch over 1f out, keeping on when hampered inside final 100 yds, rallied and finished with running left; he's versatile with regards trip on all-weather, his last win having come at 1¼m."
"8th of 18, competitive | [RACE]: A class 3 in name but at least as competitive as the majority of handicaps run here this week, even if it didn't throw up as close a finish as might have been anticipated, the winner - one of 5 3-y-os on show - getting first run on the trio who followed him home, the pace having been unsurprisingly strong and space typically at a premium as horses came off the bridle, the favourite doing about as well as could have been expected under the circumstances in finishing off well down the centre of track to take second, a well-handicapped one and a strong-travelling sort in pursuit of a hat-trick the others to make the frame. | [HORSE]: back down in trip and in first-time cheekpieces, was sent off at unflattering odds but ran much better than at Newcastle, unlucky not to finish closer too, unable to really get into full stride until late in the piece; waited with, not clear run over 2f out, switched over 1f out, kept on final 100 yds."
"14th of 21, well beaten | [RACE]: Testing conditions in which many in this big field seemed unable to cope while a draw/track bias made the race far less competitive than the field size suggests, 2 groups initially that merged before halfway, but those drawn high were always a little way in front and held a significant edge. | [HORSE]: attracted support and his form here last time was upheld by the first 2, but he wasn't seen to best effect having raced down the centre; prominent, pushed along around 3f out, weakened under 2f out."
"5th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: An absolute rogues' gallery, the addition of cheekpieces to his hood propelling Hammy End to a very rare success. | [HORSE]: ran to a similar level to last time, his stamina possibly ebbing away very late on over this 2f longer trip; dived left leaving stalls, close up, pushed along over 3f out, hung left 2f out, every chance until inside final 1f."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: All bar the pair who pulled clear were below their best in this handicap, a pretty strong gallop leaving no hiding place, but at least the winner is a 3-y-o and the runner-up arrived in form. | [HORSE]: who got no run whatsoever at Redcar last time, had no such issues on this occasion and turned in a sound effort under top weight. He looked likely to prevail until getting a bit unbalanced entering the final furlong, which handed the initiative back to Al Hargah."
"Won | [RACE]: Ordinary fare for the grade, especially with the pair at the top of the weights underperforming and Our Havana was able to take advantage of some very lenient handicapping in comfortable fashion. | [HORSE]: had other more convincing excuses than the surface for not reproducing his all-weather form at Doncaster, chiefly the combination of the trip and the tactics on the day, and he confirmed himself as leniently treated as his most recent all-weather win suggested, the decision by the BHA to split his rating meaning he was only 4 lb higher than for that 5½ length win; held up, smooth headway early in straight, led over 1f out, driven out; he's got a positive profile overall, including a good strike rate in handicaps, and will remain of plenty of interest."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: Surely a strong piece of early-season handicap form, the least exposed member of the field leading home a pair with really solid form in some of the top middle-distance handicaps last year, with another pair of unexposed 4-y-os filling the next 2 places, and it's worth taking a really positive view of the form, acknowledging it paid not to try to come from too far back. | [HORSE]: ran well at the Glorious meeting the previous July and returned from a 251-day break with another good effort. Time may tell he was facing a stiff task and he should pose a threat in some classy handicaps this year."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair nursery in which Glad Eye went off hard and set things up for the closers, though Laurens Dream got a much clearer run down the outer than some, the well-backed favourite just failing to get up having endured a much more challenging route through. | [HORSE]: was popular in the market on this handicap debut but the gamble went astray, in no small part due to some bad luck in running. A scopey sort, he's started life in handicaps from an exploitable mark and compensation awaits."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: Three-year-olds made up just under half the field but were responsible for the first 4 home, the handily-placed first 2 having it between themselves from over 1f out but, in coming from much further back, the third looks at least as interesting going forward. | [HORSE]: mightn't have been on the right part of the track but, more than that, just seemed lacklustre on the day, perhaps a fourth run in 6 weeks one too many; missed the break slightly, raced off the pace, effort on inner 2f out, edged right, left behind over 1f out."
Won | [RACE]: The in-form Good Morning Alex had little trouble continuing his good run against a decidely modest bunch. | [HORSE]: bolted up under a 6lb penalty for last Sunday's Wetherby success. A double penalty is unlikely to prevent him going in again if taking up his entry at Ripon on Friday as he's a long way ahead of his mark on turf.
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Several of the better-fancied ones patently failed to give their running in this useful handicap and, whilst the first 2 must have put up career bests in finishing so far clear, it'd surely be wrong to give them as much credit as the result might suggest; Youthful King was allowed to race clear and probably ended up doing too much in front, the main pack going along at a sound gallop regardless. | [HORSE]: has proved better than ever this season and improved further in all but defying a 5 lb rise for his Old Newton Cup success, refusing to lie down when his old rival threatened to move by; prominent main group, produced to lead 2f out, joined entering final 1f, kept on well, edged out dying strides, pulled long way clear of rest; his immediate prospects depend on what view the BHA handicapper takes of his finishing so far clear with Scampi."
"5th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: Farcical scenes early on with Neil Callan riding a finish after 5 furlongs of this 2-mile contest, but the 3 that came to the fore are all going the right way at this trip so that gives the form some substance, even if the second could have been quite a bit closer with a clearer run. | [HORSE]: tired in the final furlong but may have raced a bit closer to the early pace than ideal. She's not one to give up on just yet."
"3rd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: The well-treated Great Blasket was able to overcome trouble to justify support, though he was the only one to better fair form as the pair of 4-y-os in the line-up both failed to fire. | [HORSE]: ran creditably on this stable debut and first start for four months, not aided by having to come with his run out wide. The vet reported he lost both front shoes."
"7th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: An ordinary contest, though the winner is at least relatively unexposed, while there was drama a bit further back as the rider of St Andrew's Castle struggled to ride a finish having suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder. | [HORSE]: was well-backed, but fluffed the start and that was his fate sealed."
"5th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive handicap for the grade with several rediscovering their best form for the return to an all-weather surface, the winner digging deep. | [HORSE]: was keeping on when running into a dead end 1f out. This was a perfectly creditable effort but he wasn't an unlucky loser."
"Won | [RACE]: A couple of of 3-y-os pulled clear, the winner well treated under a penalty and both are lightly raced so are worth viewing positively enough, even if the form looks weak in behind; the pace was just modest, set by the runner-up. | [HORSE]: , who ran out an easy winner of a maiden at Ayr on her reappearance nine days earlier, had a penalty to carry but still looked well treated for her handicap debut (7lb well in). Not everything went her way (hampered at the start; wide trip) but she had too much in hand of the handicapper and won a shade cosily anyway."
"2nd of 27, involved in finish | [RACE]: Another fiercely competitive handicap at the meeting this week that proved tough to crack, though ground-wise at least it unfolded on a more level playing field than can sometimes be the case, the field initially racing as 2 groups, the majority going towards the far side with a group of 10 from the highest stalls, with the exception of Spangled Mac, coming more towards the centre, the groups converging around halfway, 3 from each side filling the first 6 places, the smaller group on the whole performing better, though that was perhaps more pace related, the far side group doing a bit too much in the early stages; the field was reduced by one after Tanmaawy got loose at the start. | [HORSE]: was 3lb well in following his Epsom second and last year's eighth ran another big race, perhaps finding himself in front earlier than desirable on the far side. He went close to providing his stable with only its second winner since January."
"Won | [RACE]: Quite an eventful 3-y-o handicap, but the loose horse didn't affect the result, the short-priced favourite winning with a fair bit up his sleeve; the gallop was sound. | [HORSE]: had hinted at ability several times before this, notably at Redcar last week, and he got off the mark at the sixth attempt. Held up early, he came with a strong run in the straight and looked set to win easily until the riderless Stripzee lugged right at the furlong pole. His rider managed to take evasive action and despite continuing to be carried right late on, he was well on top at the finish. He could rate a fair bit higher yet."
"5th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Some of those with the best recent form were unable to reproduce it, though the runner-up gives a good guide, suggesting the winner returned to something like what he was showing here last spring, the places filled by the 3 lowest drawn. | [HORSE]: ran better than last time, but no better than respectably in the grand scheme; in rear, outpaced, headway over 1f out, no further impression: not for the first time, he was reported to have bled."
"2nd of 19, involved in finish | [RACE]: A big field for one of the last big sprint handicaps of the year but like so often at this track over the last few seasons, there was an advantage to those drawn in single figures and Strike Rate followed up his Wolverhampton success back in this stronger company, those that filled the frame giving a good guide to the level of the principals. | [HORSE]: was 7lb above his last winning mark, but had the ground come right for him. Despite a higher draw than the other principals, he ran a blinder and never stopped trying."
"4th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: As with the Sprint Cup around half an hour earlier, the stand-side rail proved a big advantage, the speedy winner grabbing it early and dominating from the front, though whether his performance is quite as good as it seems at first glance is open to debate given the favourable circumstances. | [HORSE]: had rather lost his way since an encouraging start to the season but there was more promise in this with the hood he has worn on last 3 starts removed, shaping better than distance beaten suggests and he's eligible for lesser contests; waited with, late headway without being knocked about."
"10th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A very bad nursery contested by a bunch that are as uninteresting after the race was they were before; the pace was strong courtesy of the hard-pulling Budding Poet. | [HORSE]: is of no account; always behind."
"9th of 16, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Everything a big-field 3-y-o sprint handicap should be, run at strong pace with most having their chance, Up The Pace causing a shock as he held off the second favourite in determined fashion; the field came as one down the centre and the draw had little impact. | [HORSE]: had the misfortune to have run into Hammer The Hammer at Southwell last time and shaped better than the bare result back on turf; disputed lead, travelled well, pushed along 2f out, headed over 1f out, weakened; possibly did too much too soon on the front end, but was one of the last off the bridle and it's interesting to note that he was an easy winner the only time he's tackled 5f."
"12th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: An open handicap featuring largely exposed sorts, Just Dottie an exception having just her fourth Flat start and improving to deny an in-form one and another chasing her third win in this race; the field was soon quite well strung out and the third was the only one to get involved from down the field. | [HORSE]: an 11-time course winner, including over this trip earlier in the season, ran too badly to be true; in touch, pushed along entering straight, dropped away."
"Won | [RACE]: A rock-solid handicap for the grade with the most interesting pair of 3-y-os fighting things out, Maybe Not improving for the step up to 1m and well on top come the line, while a couple at bigger odds caught the eye with strong finishes from the back. | [HORSE]: is gradually revealing more of herself as she learns and the step up 1m unlocked further progress, leaving the impression she wasn't fully extended to resume winning ways at the line so there's likely more to come; slowly into stride, mid-field, pushed along 2f out, headway 1f out, led final 1f, asserted final 100 yds, well on top finish; will go on improving and is capable of defying a rise for this."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive event that included no less than 5 course winners, including the first 2 who have brilliant records here, though less than 3 lengths covered over half of the field which puts a slight dampener on the form; it got quite messy in behind late on with space at a premium though it had no major impact on the result. | [HORSE]: back under a fully-fledged rider, who sweated up beforehand; broke well, made running, went with zest, ridden around 2f out, edged left last ½f, headed final 50 yds."
"6th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A typically busy Lingfield finish means that this probably wasn't as competitive as it had looked on paper, that said, the winner is in the form of his life. | [HORSE]: was keen early and poorly positioned when the pace increased. He then got caught out wide on the home turn and this isn't a run to use as evidence the handicapper has caught up."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: The majority were 4-y-os and one making his handicap debut prevailed in a tight finish to a race which unfolded only approaching 2f out, a couple of the closers worth marking up as a result, chiefly the unlucky runner-up. | [HORSE]: turned out again quickly, has now been narrowly denied on both his starts at this track and was unlucky not to win on this occasion, coming from further back than the rest in the places and having a troubled run as a result; waited with, going well when denied a run 2f out, got gap approaching final 1f, good headway soon after, ran on, just failed; likeable and will remain of plenty of interest."
"3rd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap run at a strong pace, the winner given an uncomplicated ride and crucially stealing a march on the pair who chased him home, the favourite in third once again looking an unlucky loser. | [HORSE]: once more shaped much better than the bare result, a different rider this time but still given too much to do, Jason Hart seemingly keen to keep him under wraps for as long as possible; held up, travelled strongly, headway when short of room 2f out until entering final 1f, around 5 lengths adrift when getting gap and finished well, nearest at the finish; it's surely just a matter of time until he gains compensation in his current form."
"13th of 16, well beaten | [RACE]: A competitive affair that was the last of a long line of similar events here throughout the season and it was a very familiar story to most of those, the gallop winding up from before halfway but very few from the rear getting involved, the finish fought out between a pretty likeable pair. | [HORSE]: back under more testing conditions, is better judged on Ayr promise; raced off the pace, ridden out wide under 3f out, never involved, left poorly placed; holds an entry in the Balmoral next weekend and with Ascot likely to suit his run style, he'd be no forlorn hope were he to get in, connections having landed said event with Escobar in the past."
"3rd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair sprint handicap and the form is solid enough for the grade, a couple of 3-y-os coming to the fore. | [HORSE]: returned to form despite being taken off his feet early dropped back to 5f; held up, outpaced before halfway, stayed on final 1f, never nearer; will benefit from return to 6f."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A soundly-run affair, the pace set by the fourth and a couple made ground late on from off the gallop, but the first 2 were never far away and improved on their switch to handicaps. | [HORSE]: an all-the-way winner over the C&D last time, had a 6lb higher mark to deal with. She gave it a good go from the front once again, and lost little in defeat in being beaten by a couple of well-bred and totally unexposed rivals, and a closer from the back."
"2nd of 7, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A desperately weak race, Bradman having no trouble landing the odds back off his correct mark. | [HORSE]: upped markedly in trip for his handicap debut, ran up to the pick of his previous form; mid-field, pushed along over 3f out, wandered around 2f out, plodded on, flattered by proximity to eased-down winner."
"13th of 19, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A big-field sprint handicap that was dominated by those drawn low, the winner making all to hold off the in-form favourite with the fourth Roberto Caro the biggest eye-catcher as the only one from the wider-drawn group to get near the principals. | [HORSE]: again ran below form, admittedly not ideally placed in the unfavoured group; raced stand side, raced off the pace, ridden over 2f out, never involved."
"Won | [RACE]: A sprint handicap which proved eventful and messy throughout, one of them unseating leaving the stalls, the runner-up also poorly away, while the finish didn't get any more straightforward, Count Otto taking Magical Merlin off his line and initially losing the race in a stewards inquiry only to be reinstated on appeal. | [HORSE]: tried again in the hood and blinkers combination, was done no favours by the loose horse early but soon recovered and had run out a cosy 'winner' before losing it in the stewards' room. He did edge right on the camber but his jockey played it exactly by the rule book, both hands on the reins, hands and heels throughout the final furlong. Paradoxically, he'd have probably kept the race if winning by further under a more vigorous ride and he was reinstated to first place on appeal."
"5th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: The winner is fully exposed, but a couple of handicap debutants went with promise further back and are worth keeping on side, noticeably the second who was set too much to do. | [HORSE]: off since March and up in distance on his handicap debut, is another who has more to offer. He got no luck in running in the straight and shaped better than his finishing position."
"Won | [RACE]: The market wanted to know only one horse in this low-grade nursery and it was that horse that managed to overcome a tardy start to justify heavy support on handicap debut. | [HORSE]: after 7 weeks off (gelded in interim), was making his handicap debut and became the latest from this yard to improve significantly/land a gamble in recent weeks following on from the likes of Revolutionise, Huberts Dream and Lord Rapscallion, and he was value for a bit extra over the result, too; slowly into stride, raced off the pace, good progress under 2f out, edged ahead final 100 yds; he can't go up much for this and will surely be very interesting in a follow-up bid in a 0-65 or 0-70, likely to be at least as effective over 7f, too."
"12th of 16, competitive | [RACE]: They finished in a heap in this useful handicap and it takes a bit of unpicking, potential to be picked out rather than the race itself likely to prove strong form, the winner doing remarkably well to overcome trouble with a few others not seen to best effect either, notably Divine Libra who was gambled into favouritism; the field split into 2 groups, the 7 highest stalls coming more towards the near rail and having a slight advantage. | [HORSE]: was unable to show what he was capable of, not getting the breaks. He's already well handicapped and might be dropped a bit for this too."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Very testing conditions and a difference of opinion in the straight, the winner one of a pair that went far side; Lawn Ranger set a strong pace and a number were labouring a long way out. | [HORSE]: finished well without ever quite getting there, taking his record to 0-10. His rider appeared keen to stay near side, but he drifted across the track inside the final, conceding valuable ground in the process. He'd done his running at 1m6f at Southwell earlier in the year and shapes like a stayer."
"9th of 15, well beaten | [RACE]: Probably one of the most one-sided renewals of the 'Leger Legends', a sound pace quickly falling apart once the well-supported winner cruised into it from the rear, the second also coming from a long way back. | [HORSE]: at least shaped better than last time in first-time tongue strap but didn't see her race out back up in trip; in rear, good headway 3f out, weakened 1f out, eased off."
"7th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: Not much pace on in this handicap with the runner-up making most, but picked off by one returning to form having dropped in the weights; one or 2 of the beaten horses were better than the bare form, Mr Trick and Rebecca's Girl meeting interference while Concert Boy was nearest at the finish having had a remarkable amount of ground to make up. | [HORSE]: wasn't in quite the same form as last time, though had an excuse in that he made his effort in the centre of the track; slowly into stride, held up, progress out wide 2f out, effort flattened out."
"3rd of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A nursery that was run a just an ordinary gallop, but that didn't prevent the relative class of the winner shining through and he maintained his positive profile since switched to nurseries. | [HORSE]: back on all-weather after 7 weeks off, ran at least as well in defeat as when winning the time before, her task simply that much harder in this company from a 7 lb higher mark; led, pushed along early in straight, headed 2f out, stayed on."
"Won | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap featuring some interesting/progressive types, none more so than the cosy winner, who did well to complete the hat-trick having had to wait longer than ideal for a clear run in the straight; the early gallop was ordinary, with at least a couple of runners – most notably the fourth – racing a little too freely as a result. | [HORSE]: a good winner over C&D in July, defied a 7lb rise in this more competitive heat despite having refused to settle early on. He ended up against the far rail, which was no bad thing, and he should have even more to offer heading into the final throws of summer/autumn. His rider did pick up a small ban for careless riding."
"10th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A useful handicap, but there was a lack of pace in the early stages and the race turned into something of a 2f dash, Silver Samurai well equipped to deal with that given his background at shorter as he edged a tight finish, but some of the beaten horses will be of greater interest next time, notably the runner-up. | [HORSE]: continues to disappoint kept to turf; slowly into stride, held up, pushed along over 2f out, not quicken; it wouldn't be a surprise if he bounced back on all-weather given how good he looked at Newcastle on his stable debut."
"Won | [RACE]: A well-run handicap and the form looks solid enough for the grade, a last-time-out winner scoring at the chief expense of some of the more consistent ones. | [HORSE]: defied a 3 lb rise for her Ayr win in strikingly similar fashion with the blinkers swapped for cheekpieces, helped by having a sound pace to aim at this time and going away at the line; dropped out, still plenty to do entering straight, switched 2f out, rapid progress approaching final 1f, led last ½f, well on top finish; looks up to completing the hat-trick."
"3rd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap well worth noting, the well-supported Chesspiece giving a form boost to the winner of the Lingfield Derby Trial and chased home by a collection of well-connected rivals that can expect to be figuring prominently in high-profile handicaps during the summer; Knockbrex set an honest pace and the first 2 made plenty of ground up in the straight. | [HORSE]: runner-up on soft ground at Newmarket on handicap debut, coped just fine with the longer trip on quicker ground and has more to offer."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: Strong-looking handicap form, a last-time-out winner coming out on top and chased home by some in-form sorts; the gallop was strong and the complexion of the race changed in the last 2f, Johnny Boom forced wide but avoiding the trouble to his inside as the leaders folded. | [HORSE]: could be forgiven her last time out defeat and was unfortunate not to get even closer this time, having been buffeted around once turning in. She got this new trip well and can continue to build on recent efforts, particularly at this track."
"3rd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sprint handicap which proved eventful and messy throughout, one of them unseating leaving the stalls, the runner-up also poorly away, while the finish didn't get any more straightforward, Count Otto taking Magical Merlin off his line and initially losing the race in a stewards inquiry only to be reinstated on appeal. | [HORSE]: back on turf, had excuses last time and otherwise has a largely progressive profile. He can remain competitive off this sort of mark"
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that was strongly run, Dutch Kingdom a decisive winner and chased home by one from out the back, both helped by being well out of the shemozzle after 2f that affected 5 of the 6 horses that were in a line disputing second, 3 of them essentially losing all chance and the form ought to the treated with caution as a result. | [HORSE]: got back on the up, having no trouble with the first try at 6f granted a well-run race, but he got a charmed run through compared to some and his superiority was perhaps a little exaggerated; mid-field, progress on inner over 2f out, switched early in straight, led inside final 1f, drew clear."
"5th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap in which the 3 horses having their first run for new yards all shaped well to varying degrees, none more so than a smooth winner who was supplementing her success in a similar race here last spring; the pace was good. | [HORSE]: shaped better than the bare result on first outing since leaving Charlie Johnston (sold 14,000 gns) after 3 months off, a bit fresh to fully last out but clear promise in a move from the back that took him into second briefly; held up, took strong hold, progress under 3f out, effort flattened out final 1f, not unduly punished; he's the sort his new yard can place to advantage at a lowly level (qualified for 0-55s) and is one to look out for."
"5th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The leaders went off quickly setting this up for the closers, the winner's stamina coming fully in to play. | [HORSE]: a stablemate of the runner-up, travelled really well in a disputed lead but found disappointingly little off the bridle. Perhaps 7f suits him better now."
"5th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: None of the fancied ones fired, putting a dampner on the form of a useful handicap run at a slow gallop, but the winner looks full value for an improved effort. | [HORSE]: is better judged on previous form, having little chance the way this developed; dwelt, held up, took keen hold, still plenty to do under 2f out, late headway, left poorly placed; there's nothing wrong with his Newcastle form and he's worth another chance to prove himself still well handicapped."
"2nd of 13, competitive | [RACE]: A modestly-run 0-60 in which a couple pulled their chance away and the 2 recent winners deserve credit for finishing comfortably on top of the prominent brigade, the winner haivng been brought right to the stand rail in the latter stages. | [HORSE]: again ran well, going down only to another thriving one who has recently switched yards; mid-division, shuffled back before halfway, progress out wide over 2f out, ran on and took second final 100 yds, ran on, no impression on winner but pulling away from the rest at the line and worth marking up a touch as a result of where he had to come from; will remain of interest."
"Won | [RACE]: A one-sided staying contest, Spirit Mixer impressing with a useful performance and powering clear late on. | [HORSE]: is thriving at present and followed up from last time, improving in the process and impressing with how quickly he sealed matters, though will now be due a hefty rise up the weights; waited with, smooth headway under 3f out, led on bridle over 1f out, driven soon after, stayed on strongly."
"5th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Little pace on in this sprint, the field finishing well bunched with the first 2 best positioned, Arnaz in third looking unlucky having not got the clearest of runs while Rhythmic Acclaim also met trouble, the form unlikely to prove solid even if the profiles of several suggest it could work out quite well. | [HORSE]: who notched consecutive 6f wins at this course (twice) and Goodwood last year, is better than her finishing position suggests, repeatedly short of room in the last quarter mile. There's another race in her when things pan out more favourably."
"4th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: Some pretty stern mid-race fractions blew this race apart and few ever really held a winning chance. | [HORSE]: well backed, settled better than usual but couldn't translate that to an improved performance; held up, laboured headway towards centre of track 2f out, plugged on."
"7th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: There were a few less-exposed types in this ordinary handicap, but they failed to get seriously involved and it was an experienced, in-form sort who took it convincingly. | [HORSE]: was smuggled into the race from the rear but typically found less than promised; awkward leaving stalls, in rear, took strong hold, headway 2f out, ridden inside final 1f, no further impression."
"3rd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A messy race, several suffering in-running trouble and the pace failing to hold up, the veteran of the field swooping late to land the spoils and the third unlucky not to win; high draws were at an advantage, the first 3 all drawn in double figures. | [HORSE]: is the type who needs things to drop right and was unlucky not to win, travelling best but not getting the breaks until the race was all but over; in rear, going well when not clear run from 2f out, got gap last ½f, ran on late."
"3rd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap but it wasn't truly run, the runners finishing in the order in which they'd raced for the first half of the contest, the sole last-time-out winner always in pole position to follow up. | [HORSE]: a three-time AW winner who had finished unplaced in three previous turf starts, ranged up alongside the winner going best 2f out but found less than looked likely when asked for his effort. He remains lightly raced on the turf and this was not without promise."
"8th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A lack of pace in this useful handicap meant a prominent position was of paramount importance, a decisive move from the stalls by David Egan ensuring Myal was able to mitigate his wide stall and resume winning ways in game fashion; Fair Point and the gambled-on Witch Hunter met trouble, but they would have been just bit-part players regardless. | [HORSE]: , absent for 145 days, was a handful in the preliminaries and likely left his race behind before the start."
"4th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: A fillies' handicap that was soundly run and seems likely to throw up winners, the first 4 all on an upward curve to varying degrees. | [HORSE]: has some strong form to her name from her 2-y-o days (beat a clutch of subsequent improvers here on final outing), but looked rusty making handicap debut after 6 months off; in touch, pushed along 3f out, didn't do anything quickly but stuck to task; wasn't beaten that far in the end and worth a chance to do better at this trip another day."
"12th of 15, well beaten | [RACE]: This handicap was set up for the closers, the front pair taking different paths to challenge, whilst the third was unlucky not to finish a little closer to them. | [HORSE]: in first-time cheekpieces and back down in trip, can easily have this run ignored; in touch, pushed along 3f out, clipped heels and stumbled badly over 2f out which nearly unseated rider, eased soon after."
"9th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A slow pace didn't stop some of the more interesting ones coming to the fore, the winner arriving on the back of one all-weather handicap and chased home by a quartet of handicap debutants; the runner-up met trouble but it's hard to call him an unlucky loser given the winner had something up his sleeve. | [HORSE]: upped in trip after 6 months off, is better than could show here; mid-division, took strong hold, chased leaders over 3f out, keeping on when snatched up entering final 1f, not recover."
"10th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: There mightn't have been anything within a stone of the ceiling rating of 105, but it shouldn't be taken that this was anything other than a really well-contested affair for what was a very valuable fillies' handicap, unexposed 3-y-os making up 3 of the first 4 home from a little under half the field numerically, the winner producing a fine display of galloping from the front. | [HORSE]: underperformed; in touch, went prominent briefly 3f out, effort proved short-lived."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: Not the deepest renewal of this longstanding handicap, a 0-105 in which only 2 of them wouldn't have got into a 0-85, but that pair came well clear at the end of a soundly-run race and the form among them looks strong, with the next couple home of some interest, too. | [HORSE]: was largely progressive at 3 and took it up another notch on her return, impressing with the way she got to the front, briefly going clear before getting worn down by a strong stayer at the trip. She'll go up a bit for not winning but there's likely more to come and she'll remain of interest in handicaps, although connections will presumably be eyeing Listed/Group 3 events among her own sex as well."
"3rd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair apprentice handicap which produced a remarkable winning performance by the rider aboard Dalby Forest, Olivia Haines severely inconvenienced by a slipped saddle but somehow able to summon up a finishing effort to lead close home before the pairing finally parted company just after the line; the first 2 raced on the front end and had it between themselves in the straight. | [HORSE]: well backed in first-time hood, was returned to 5f and ran better than last time without picking up well enough to trouble the first 2; mid-field, headway when short of room home turn, switched inside over 1f out, not quicken, not knocked about."
"Won | [RACE]: A race for apprentices that had not ridden more than 10 winners, and there was major misjudgement from 4 of them, firstly in allowing the winner to build up such an advantage without having to work hard and then in not responding early enough when it was apparent the gap was uncomfortably big, resulting in 10-day bans for the 4 beaten riders; the winning time was really slow, and clearly a very cautious view of the winner's performance is needed. | [HORSE]: up in trip, was allowed to establish an extremely long lead, and, having set only a modest gallop, won a weak event by a wide margin with her rider motionless throughout. This isn't form to take at face value as all her rivals were given far too much to do and her short-term future depends on the handicapper's reaction, though she'll escape a penalty (in anything other than apprentice races) before reassessment."
"7th of 26, fairly beaten | [RACE]: They split into 3 groups in this good-quality 3-y-o handicap, those on the far side disadvantaged compared to the rest, the finish fought out by a pair of improvers, the winner switching to the centre from the near side to launch his bid, while the winner drifted towards him in the final 1f, possible that lug cost him the race given the narrow margin he was beaten. | [HORSE]: in first-time cheekpieces, only ran to a similar level to last time but shaped better, deserving extra credit having been up with the pace in race where the first 3 all came from further back; led group in centre, ridden 2f out, weakened final 1f."
"7th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: A strong-looking race confined to those who'd won no more than once, as many as 6 of them having done so on their latest outing, most also making their first start in a nursery and such types came to the fore, the well-backed Sword Maker thumping them in a good time despite the next best runner from a double-figure draw managing only seventh, the field having raced in 2 groups until around halfway. | [HORSE]: ran as well as could be expected contesting another competitive race, beaten only by the winner among the high-drawn runners; slowly into stride, raced stand side, soon close up, chased leader 2f out, beaten when carried left 1f out."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap run at a steady gallop, so it reflects well on the winner that he managed to come from the rear, picking off an in-form sort who was kept much handier. | [HORSE]: has some good form in minor events, notably his second at Doncaster and, after 9 weeks off, improved a chunk to get off the mark; dwelt, in rear, settled better than last time, driven 3f out, progress over 1f out, hampered soon after, stayed on to lead final 100 yds; overcame pace bias here and will remain of plenty of interest."
"10th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Low-grade handicap form that's worth following, cases to be made for each of the 6 that contested a blanket finish, several of whom experienced varying degrees of hard luck, one that had caught the eye last time just prevailing. | [HORSE]: pulled way too hard, but she wasn't completely done with when finding little room from the 2f marker. This was a run to forgive."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sprint handicaps in which it proved hard to get involved from too far back despite the even gallop, but it's still form that should work out, the market leaders filling the first 2 places. | [HORSE]: back at the scene of last month's win, was strong in the market but he ended up further back in the pack than ideal in a race lacking pace (front three finished 3-1-4). He was the only one able to make up ground, and should remain of interest round here off this sort of mark."
"8th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A useful handicap but one in which making up ground from off the pace proved difficult, the principals all up there throughout and the winner defying a wide draw to make all, some of those further back probably best not judged too harshly given how his panned out. | [HORSE]: is best not judged on this run, left poorly placed from a tricky draw, not one to give up on from this sort of mark; slowly into stride, raced well off the pace, plugged on final 1f, never nearer."
"4th of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: A thin handicap, though Central City proved himself to be in his best form for a while in making light of the appreciably longer trip. | [HORSE]: better known as a chaser these days, needed to be shoved along early to take hold of the bridle. He travelled well enough in rear after that, but when asked for more there was nothing left. He is now 0-24 under both codes on these shores."
"4th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: Still a big field for this track, despite the withdrawal of those drawn in 15 and 16 and it was run at a sound gallop, Evocative Spark looking the likely winner for a long way but run down by a late closer than got a clearer run than some, Truely Aclaimed unlucky while Grifter was value for finishing closer, the form appealing as likely to work out quite well. | [HORSE]: won twice over C&D last year and showed improved form making handicap debut after 7 months off; mid-field, pushed along early in straight, chased leader 1f out, bumped final 100 yds, no extra; she shaped as if likely to come on for this fitness-wise and will go on improving, all in all, the type to win more races this time around."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: The first 3 from the Spring Cup headed the market, with the runner-up then a short price to go one better, that one disappointing but the form upheld by the other pair, this race overall looking solid, the time comparing well with that for the Lockinge 70 minutes earlier; the field raced as more-or-less 3 groups until 3f out, the best pace on the stand side, the first 2 racing off the pace on the far side until being switched to the stand side as the groups merged. | [HORSE]: confirmed himself an improved performer this year, following a similar route to the winner but no match for him after getting smoothly into the race, likely to continue to run with credit in the top 1m handicaps; raced far side, patiently ridden, travelled well, switched to near side 3f out, smooth headway under 2f out, shaken up and every chance inside final 1f, kept on."
"5th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: The winner and fourth were among those who'd already landed a race this year and the pair sandwiched between them give their running more often than the conventional sprint handicapper at this sort of grade, though the most significant aspect of a race featuring several old rivals was the fact all 4 were drawn middle-to-high and raced towards the near side; Army of India was withdrawn after refusing to enter the stalls. | [HORSE]: with the action developing centre to stands' side, gets credit for doing best of those racing more towards the far side. The first-time cheekpieces weren't a negative."
"6th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A lowly handicap run at a slow pace, the quirky winner doing well to get up close home, the favourite in fourth having his work cut out the way this unfolded. | [HORSE]: well backed, is best not judged on this run, none of his recent races showing him to best effect in fact, presumably not the easiest ride but he is coming down the weights and unexposed at this sort of trip; dwelt, held up, raced freely, headway out wide home turn, never a threat, had a hopeless task from position."
"7th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: With a quartet of last-time-out winners in attendance and almost half of the field 3-y-os this had the makings of a competitive event, though it failed to develop until approaching 2f out which resulted in a bunched finish, the time a second slower than the first division, those in the frame bar Acotango racing on the speed. | [HORSE]: had split a pair of next-time-out winners over C&D last time but wasn't seen to anything like best effect, a typically sluggish start putting him immediately on the back foot and the lack of a gallop of no use to him; patiently ridden, pushed along over 2f out, still plenty to do over 1f out, progress out wide entering final 1f, finished with running left; bears repeating that his start for the yard has been positive and he'll remain of plenty of interest granted a well-run race, especially so in a 0-75."
"4th of 20, involved in finish | [RACE]: Only the second running of this competitive event, though with the market leaders disappointing and - unsurprisingly with the exclusion of 3-y-os - improvers thin on the ground, it's no more than useful form, the race itself similar in many ways to last year, a well-run contest but it proved hard for many to make inroads from the rear, high draws also predominantly coming to the fore, no coincidence that they were able to avoid the scrimmaging towards the inner, the fourth shaping a bit better than the distance beaten suggests, as did Farhh To Shy further back. | [HORSE]: enjoyed a ground-saving trip into the straight but then ran into some traffic issues, got shuffled back as the race was developing and rallied too late to have a proper say. On another day she might have gone close."
"5th of 5, well beaten | [RACE]: Essentially only a 4-runner race with Miami Thunder static in the stalls, the lightly-raced winner scoring decisively after the market had once again spoke firmly in his favour. | [HORSE]: after 3 months off; virtually refused to race."
"5th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A rough nursery with loads getting in each other's way in the straight, the winner one of only a few to enjoy a trouble-free passage and gutsing it out to fend off one that had to wait for a gap and another that was forced to come widest of all. | [HORSE]: settled better back sprinting for his nursery debut after 8 weeks off but is evidently on no more than an average mark; pressed leader, edged ahead early in straight, headed entering final 1f, faded."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: Not much pace on in this handicap with the runner-up making most, but picked off by one returning to form having dropped in the weights; one or 2 of the beaten horses were better than the bare form, Mr Trick and Rebecca's Girl meeting interference while Concert Boy was nearest at the finish having had a remarkable amount of ground to make up. | [HORSE]: is established a strong traveller that sometimes flatters to decieve, but he's clearly in good form at present, doing well under the circumstances having been left with a huge amount to do; dropped out, typically travelled well, still going well with rider virtually motionless over 1f out, ran on and never nearer."
"7th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: A tight-knit, low-grade handicap dominated by the 3-y-os, a couple who arrived on the back of in-frame efforts first and third and split by one who took well to more severe headgear; the gallop seemed fair. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in reasonable form, not seen to best effect; raced wide, in rear, hampered 3f out and left poorly placed, not clear run 1f out, finished with running left; showed a high carriage and is a long-standing maiden, though."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap taken in good style by a class dropper who's value for a little extra having come from rear in a race hardly run at a breakneck gallop. | [HORSE]: benefited from a drop in grade and return to patient tactics as she swept through and easily went clear. Both her wins have come at this trip and, based on this effort, she should be able to make her mark returned to better handicaps or even pick up some black type."
"13th of 14, well beaten | [RACE]: A rough, low-grade contest with plenty finding trouble at some stage, most notably the fourth who would have been second granted a clear passage. | [HORSE]: without a tongue strap this time, can easily have a line put through this run on first outing since leaving Iain Jardine after 11 months off (from jumps); slowly into stride, raced off the pace, badly hampered end of back straight, eased off."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: All-weather handicap form hardly gets more solid than this, a strong gallop having the field soon well strung out and the quartet that dominated the market came to the fore, Alrehb continuing to go from strength to strength as he ran down the favourite late on. | [HORSE]: had winning run ended but is still gradually getting better and remains with a positive profile; chased leaders, pushed along over 2f out, forced wide home turn, led inside final 1f, hung right, headed final 100 yds, kept on; he holds a Lincoln entry but is yet to run on turf."
"9th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: A very messy handicap run at a steady pace in which a couple got no run at all, but the winner quickened up well from a poor position after travelling strongly. | [HORSE]: has been a model of consistency this season but never got a chance to open up, trapped on the rail behind the weakening Go Sing; handy, denied a run over 1f out, not knocked about."
"6th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Surely a strong piece of early-season handicap form, the least exposed member of the field leading home a pair with really solid form in some of the top middle-distance handicaps last year, with another pair of unexposed 4-y-os filling the next 2 places, and it's worth taking a really positive view of the form, acknowledging it paid not to try to come from too far back. | [HORSE]: last seen disappointing over hurdles, ran creditably back on the Flat after 5 months off, entitled to sharpen up for this; missed the break, raced well off the pace, still plenty to do over 2f out, hung right, plugged on against far rail, not knocked about."
"Won | [RACE]: Another race that unfolded over on the far side, Tiriac having to find his way through, but ultimately well on top in a race where conditions exaggerated the margins. | [HORSE]: had run well on soft ground at Leicester last month and he gained his first handicap success in good style. He was tanking along but with nowhere to go 2f out but his jockey bided his time and he found plenty in the final furlong to record a comfortable win. He will remain of interest when reassessed, especially on slow ground."
"2nd of 4, well beaten | [RACE]: A disappointing turnout numerically, and none of the 4-y-os gave their running, exaggerating the winner's margin of victory, but he clearly took a big step forward all the same; despite the small field the pace was honest and the timefigure adds substance. | [HORSE]: back over his optimum trip, had no chance with the 3yo but probably ran up to his best. He remains capable away from such progressive types."
"4th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap in which a bit of improvement went a long way so far as Maids Head was concerned, breaking her duck at the tenth attempt, but she got first run on several rivals and wouldn't be sure to confirm placings another day, the runner-up getting stuck in traffic while Stella Hogan and Windsor Pass both got caught too far back. | [HORSE]: remains in good form and was unlucky not to finish closer for all some of the problems she encountered were typically of her own doing; very slowly away, raced well off the pace, headway early in straight, ran on, left with too much to do."
"11th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A fair handicap taken by one who was back to form and handles soft ground well; the bulk of the field went far side as usual on the straight track here, a pair that stayed in the centre ending up well held. | [HORSE]: can have a line put through this run, having little chance as one of a pair that stayed in the centre of the track; slowly into stride, raced off the pace, hung left over 2f out, never involved."
"10th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: An ordinary apprentice handicap of which the main feature was the strong pace, though the winner still did well to get there given she came from such a long way back to lead on the line. | [HORSE]: overdid it on the front end back down in trip; soon led, went clear before home turn, headed 1f out, soon beaten, went off too hard."
"5th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A handicap that was won comfortably by the thriving favourite, a couple of other last-time-out scorers not seen to best effect in fourth and fifth, this a race that promises to throw up winners in the coming weeks. | [HORSE]: with the pace holding up, was up against it in his hat-trick bid. He did run on well in the straight but this didn't set up for him."
"Won | [RACE]: Low-grade fare but four of the sextet came into the race in good form, while the reappearing Abound was well backed after a long absence; the winner Fred Bear was ignored in a clear lead. | [HORSE]: made the most of a big pull in the weights., running well in defeat over hurdles earlier in the year, built on the encouragement he'd shown on his return to the Flat in first-time cheekpieces behind Harry The Norseman at Bath the previous month, taking advantage of these 10lb better terms (taking into account his rider's claim) under an enterprising front-running ride. Stamina is clearly a strength of his, so he'll certainly warrant another try at 2m on the Flat, but he's heading to Jersey for their Champion Hurdle on the 24th."
"5th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: Probably not a bad piece of class 6 3-y-o handicap form, some good yards represented and the first 2 in particular both bred to be much better at 3 yrs than they showed at 2 yrs, the 2 of them right to the fore from halfway. | [HORSE]: , who's been gelded and changed stables, was sent off favourite on his handicap debut, but he was a bit keen in the early stages and didn't see his race out having come through to challenge. This trip shouldn't be a problem on pedigree and he can step forward from this."
"8th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: Several of these looked open to progress and, whilst only one of the field had a BHA rating of more than 90 coming into the race, it's still good-looking form by staying handicap standards, the first 2 plainly improving for a longer trip and several others likely to be interesting in lesser handicaps another day. | [HORSE]: didn't improve for his first attempt at 1¾m but is well worth another go at the trip, his opening mark looking prohibitive and not helped by being caught at least 3-wide until entering the home straight; mid-field, out wide, pushed along early in straight, close up over 2f out, faded approaching final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: A competitive handicap on paper but it proved straightforward for the revitalised winner, landing a gamble with plenty in hand; the pace was ordinary. | [HORSE]: gambled on, exploited a much-reduced all-weather mark with plenty in hand, the drop in grade clearly helping, but the zest he went through this contest with suggested the 3-month break had done plenty for his enthusiasm, too, so he's bound to make appeal again given how much higher in the weights he was this time last year; mid-field, travelled strongly, good headway out wide early in straight, led 1f out, edged left, drew clear, had plenty in hand; will remain of interest."
"4th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Only a small field but it still got rather messy late on, the winner getting the gap when needed along the generally favoured near-side rail, while several of those a bit further back got no room to work with. | [HORSE]: a C&D winner last August, showed plenty of foot but will be of more interest when it looks as though he'll get an easier time in front."
"7th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The winner was able to control a slow gallop, the second never far away either, a couple forced very wide to make progress over 2f out with the field still tightly grouped and it's hard to think this is particularly strong or robust form. | [HORSE]: easy to back, is better than she could show here, though she certainly didn't find as much as had seemed likely; mid-field, smooth headway out wide over 2f out, promised more than delivered."
"3rd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap, confined to 4-y-o+, the 3 youngest runners finishing in the last 4, the pace a sound one, which suggests the form should prove reliable, the field coming off the rail in the straight, though the one rider that thought about coming right over to the stand side changed his mind when no one followed. | [HORSE]: likely would have finished second but for hanging, indeed he may have given the winner more of a race. Up another 2lb after a good run in defeat at Kempton, he still appears on the up and is likely capable of winning again before season's end, with him being relatively fresh for the time of year."
"8th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: This renewal of a valuable 3-y-o event probably wasn't as ultra-competitive as the last few years - plenty of rain having fallen early in week perhaps a factor - but it still appeals as a solid piece of form; it typically paid to be handy, the prolific and progressive winner making all, Two Tribes the only one to make any serious inroads from off the pace, they also split in to 2 groups, the 5 highest drawn runners staying towards the far side with the remainder in the centre, the 2 merging over 1f out and it seemed a level playing field, a couple that ended up closest to the stand rail shaping well. | [HORSE]: failed to justify strong support returned to 6f, this mark possibly not as lenient as it had looked prior to Ascot; raced far side, mid-division, shaken up over 2f out, brief headway over 1f out, no further impression."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Rule 4 30p in £ applies to all SPs A fillies' handicap that lost some of its interest when the short-priced favourite Queen's Fair was withdrawn at the start, the pair of 4-y-os who dead-heated not needing to show any improvement, suggesting this is just ordinary form; the gallop was reasonable. | [HORSE]: showed benefit of reappearance run, shaping better than the distance beaten suggests; awkward leaving stalls and almost unseated, raced off the pace, shaken up over 2f out, switched towards outer final 1f, kept on well final 100 yds, finished with running left and never nearer; only 1 lb higher in the weights than for latest win and one to bear in mind, especially if turning up in a 0-60."
"13th of 14, well beaten | [RACE]: A very competitive handicap that featured six last-time-out winners and a host of other in-form horses; the gallop set by the two leaders was overly strong but even so it paid not to challenge from too far back. | [HORSE]: ran no sort of race; raced well off the pace, eased over 1f out."
"2nd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: This can hardly be described as a deep handicap by 0-95 standards, the top weights racing from a 10-lb lower mark than the ceiling and half the field plainly failing to show their form, but the winner is proving gradually progressive and almost certainly produced a career best in fending off the two 3-y-os; an ordinary gallop dictated speed was tested far more than stamina. | [HORSE]: was keen and became slightly outpaced turning in, so the fact that he finished strongly once switched means this performance can be marked up. He remains a maiden and will need to settle better, but he stayed the trip well and he seems sure to win races."
"7th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A well-run contest and the winner found progress to get off the mark on handicap debut, staying on the best down the outside as things got tight more towards the inner. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form, moving with menace but not picking up once finally in the clear; in touch, travelled well, short of room over 1f out, not clear run final 1f, no extra last ½f."
"7th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: Daphne May going off odds-on shows the general lack of compelling recent form on offer, and it's probably not a race to dwell on, the stable-switching winner soon in front and slipping the field over 2f out. | [HORSE]: had a wide journey over the longer trip and couldn't reproduce the form of her Kempton second earlier in the month. A drop back to 1m should help. Trainer Gary Moore felt that the filly ran flat due to the race coming too soon after her previous run."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap turned into a rout by a much-improved stable switcher. | [HORSE]: was far less exposed than the rest and showed much improved form in running out a facile winner on first outing for a new yard (left Peter Chapple-Hyam) after 8 months off; tracked pace, shaken up 2f out, quickened to lead approaching final 1f, soon clear; would take plenty of beating if turned out under a penalty."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap that saw the in-form winner and third split by an enigmatic sort bouncing back to his best under a forceful ride. | [HORSE]: probably lost his race at the start, also not helped by having to come wide off the final bend. He did well all things considered and will be of interest next time."
"Won | [RACE]: None of the quartet of 4-y-os raised their game but to suggest it would have mattered would be foolishly contrarian even by the standards of the wider modern climate such was the obscene dominance of Vauban, who made even a 3-digit BHA mark look laughable under a positive ride that had him clear 2f out, most of the vanquished probably best forgiven their failures considering the exceptional circumstances in what is supposed to be one of the most competitive handicaps of the entire year and indeed normally is. | [HORSE]: succeeded with rare dominance where stablemate Bring On The Night had failed over an hour earlier, becoming the shortest-priced handicap winner at the meeting this century - and coming up short by only ½ length to equalling Red Fort's record for the largest winning margin in such races here during that period achieved in the 2004 Wolferton - as he made a mark based on his French form prove woefully inadequate, ridden with more dash than when falling just short at the top level over hurdles in 2022/23 and delivering when asked to extend, stretching right away from a good-quality field with extreme authority, the archetypal pattern-class horse in a handicap for a trainer saddling his ninth Royal Ascot success; races such as the Irish St Leger will surely be on his agenda, a win in which - or any other Group 1 on the Flat for that matter - would see him emulate in reverse the same yard's Wicklow Brave, who was the last horse to win a top-level race both on the Flat and over jumps."
"Won | [RACE]: A race with a well-earned reputation as one of the strongest 3-y-o handicaps in the calendar, Quinault getting the better of subsequent pattern winners Washington Heights and Mill Stream in last year's renewal, but this year's race comes with a couple of caveats, heavily influenced by draw and pace, the winner ideally positioned to pick up the pieces, but value for a smart effort all the same under his big weight as he swept through from last, the placed pair and Tropical Island who seemed to need to run likely to be of more immediate interest. | [HORSE]: was back on softer ground and got back on the up as he defied top-weight by a clear margin, though was seen to maximum effect on the day; in rear, uncomfortable with pace, headway over 2f out, stayed on to lead inside final 1f, driven out, suited by the strong pace; he's fluffed his lines in pattern/listed company this year already, but this suggests he ought to make a better fist of it now, his profile similar to the stable's 2022 winner Harry Three who won a listed race at Deauville on his next start and a similar route looks the obvious plan, though connections were mooting an outing under a penalty in the Wokingham."
"5th of 10, competitive | [RACE]: A messy nursery, the short-priced favourite Irrelevant seemingly toying with his opposition on the bridle but not quite providing a push-button response, consequently left with nowhere to go as the winner jolted left to his outer, causing a chain reaction of bumps and baulks inside the closing stages. | [HORSE]: looked well-in under a penalty (BHA mark 3 lb higher) and travelled like the best horse in the race, though didn't settle the question as quickly as looked likely and was left out of contention when badly squeezed between Go Your Own Way and Monks Mead as the former edged left; tracked pace, travelled best, upsides over 2f out, shaken up approaching final 1f, badly hampered and no chance soon after, hung left and eased when beaten."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A slowly-run affair that played much more to the strengths of the prominently-ridden winner than it did the fast-finishing runner-up making his effort from further back. | [HORSE]: back on all-weather, wasted no time getting back on track, just caught a bit further back than ideal on the day; mid-field, took strong hold, headway approaching straight, ridden over 1f out, stayed on, conceded first run."
"10th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: The right horses came to the fore in a fair handicap run at a good pace, the form likely to stand up. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, went backwards from reappearance, probably at a disadvantage in racing alone on the fair rail, though he again looked a less-than-straightforward conveyance; close up, hung right from 3f out, dropped away under 2f out."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful fillies' handicap that was blown apart by a 3-y-o who showed improvement, Another Romance putting up the sort of effort to suggest she's worth a try in listed/minor pattern company against her own sex. | [HORSE]: back down in trip and returned to turf, showed improved form from out of the blue to win in a handicap for the first time having been beaten from this mark on her 4 previous starts; dwelt, mid-field, chased leaders before halfway, quickened to lead 2f out, edged left, drew clear; the time/sectional upgrade back up the effort and she'll be worth trying in better company, though won't have the benefit of her rider's claim if she does go into listed/pattern races."
"Won | [RACE]: Neither the prize money nor the quality of field matched this race's class 2 status, and a steady gallop dictated by the winner adds to the negativity, though Box To Box did at least seal matters quite impressively. | [HORSE]: made it 3 from 4 this year, clearly improving, but he was found another good opportunity and it was his speed for shorter that proved the key asset against largely more staying types having been allowed the run of the race; dictated, quickened under 3f out, went clear 1f out, won easily; he may go up more than is justified for this."
"8th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: Form that perhaps has more substance to it than appears at first glance, the lightly-raced winner seeming to have turned over a new leaf and holding on from a pair that are lurking on dangererous marks. | [HORSE]: a revelation since blinkers were enlisted including four wins here, looked a big threat when smoothly moving into contention out wide, but having made his effort he faded rather tamely. He is still 7lb above his last winning mark and perhaps the handicapper has finally caught up with him."
"Won | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap run at an ordinary pace and several were in with a chance inside the final 1f, though the strong-travelling winner ultimately did it in good style once getting the gaps. | [HORSE]: delivered under a confident ride, getting the splits at the right time on this occasion and well on top at the line, though his style means he always comes with risks attached; held up, travelled strongly, good headway 1f out, got gap last ½f, quickened to lead close home."
"8th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap but it should work out, the comfortable winner given an uncomplicated ride and in command in the straight, a couple of last-time-out winners that attemped to come from the rear in a modestly-run affair not having much go right. | [HORSE]: shaped much better than the bare result having been set a lot to do, not getting any room in the straight; held up, pushed along 2f out, headway when no room from 1f out, not recover, would have benefited from a stronger gallop; will remain of interest."
"3rd of 8, competitive | [RACE]: The favourite ran below expectations and the winner was the only one to find any improvement, seeing out the longer trip well as she doubled her career tally. | [HORSE]: , chasing a quick hat-trick, was 4lb well in under her double penalty, but she was up from Class 6 and didn't pick up this time. She might need a breather now."
"Won | [RACE]: A lowly event dominated by those who raced closest to the stand rail - which can be the case in the sprints here - the first 2 worth marking up a little however, having found trouble, Foreseeable Future shaping well on the other flank. | [HORSE]: back under a fully-fledged rider, capitalised on the drop in grade to get off the mark, benefiting from the step back up in trip, also very much in the right place near the stand rail; in touch, effort when short of room under 2f out, quickened to lead last ½f, won readily."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap in which the front pair pulled a little way clear, the winner giving away several lengths at the start but proving game to follow up last year's win in this race. | [HORSE]: had dipped below his last winning mark and did remarkably well to follow up last year's success in this race; very slowly away, soon behind, smooth headway out wide over 3f out, shaken up 2f out, challenged approaching final 1f, led final strides; he's struggled to be competitive from marks in the mid-80s previously, so he doesn't look an obvious sort to follow up, especially given his antics at the start."
"8th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A surprise result to a low-grade affair, though there was no real element of fluke about it, the third sent for home early in the straight and the first 6 ending up in a bit of a heap. | [HORSE]: failed to justify support upped in trip; mid-division, refused to settle, in touch when not clear run over 2f out, shaken up before final 1f, carried head awkwardly, not persevered with once held."
"10th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: The usual far-side bias was turned on its head in the finale, the field racing as one over on that side of the track but several got in each other's way as the leaders came back after setting a sound pace and the places were filled by 3 from high draws that had an uninterrupted run out wide, the form anything but solid with Angel of the Bay, Ratafia and Operation Gimcrack all better than the result having encountered trouble. | [HORSE]: back on turf following an encouraging reappearance and shaped much better than the bare result, not stretching it to say that he might have won on another day, switched to the far rail from his wide draw but finding all the trouble going; slowly into stride, held up, pushed along 3f out, headway on rail over 2f out, no room over 1f out and passing the post full of running; well bred and unexposed, there are races to be won with him."
"4th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap run at a sound pace, the winner doing well to dig deep having been close to the gallop, finding plenty on a rare outing at this trip, but the fourth would have been bang there with a clear run. | [HORSE]: had narrowly beaten the winner 9 days earlier and would have been firmly in the mix again with a clearer run back up in trip, unlucky not to finish closer; held up, travelled fluently, headway when short of room over 1f out, keeping on when no room late on, not recover."
"7th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: A well-run contest won in good style by one that had been shaping up well for an in-form yard. | [HORSE]: poorly drawn, covered plenty of ground and was buffeted around in the straight, causing his girth to snap. It's best to put a line through this."
"7th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: Conditions were filthy by this stage of the card and plenty simply couldn't cope, best to treat the form with a sizeable chunk of caution as a result, the winner seen to maximum advantage in grabbing the inside rail from the off and making all, in command over 2f out. | [HORSE]: had coped with soft ground on her previous start but this was a different level of testing and she's better judged on previous form; dropped out, brief headway over 4f out, no further impression."
"2nd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modest nursery run in testing conditions that proved too much for the favourite, the winner finding plenty to lead late on. | [HORSE]: popular in the market on his handicap debut, travelled best and looked the likeliest winner most of the way, but he still looked a bit green, hanging left under pressure. Having had to battle the third he proved vulnerable late on to the strong-finishing winner. He can do better."
"Won | [RACE]: A big-field apprentice handicap but only one horse mattered, the well-supported Wrydcroft far too progressive for this lot and maintaining an unbeaten start in handicaps. | [HORSE]: is improving in leaps and bounds and made light of a 3 lb rise for his recent C&D success in emphatic fashion; mid-division, tanked along, headway halfway, led on bridle over 2f out, shaken up over 1f out, clear when edged right final 1f, won easily; the handicapper is sure to react accordingly, so it may prove wise to get him out again quickly (would escape a penalty in all bar apprentice races), though the likelihood is he'll still be eligible for similar contests once reassessed."
"Won | [RACE]: Another class 2 all-weather sprint handicap that was woefully short on numbers, but despite that they still got racing too far out, the warm favourite's chances compromised by taking on Ornate up front, and that teed things up for the thriving Strong Power. | [HORSE]: a C&D winner four days earlier, was running from a long way out of the handicap, even with his penalty. That didn't stop him from running at least as well as ever, and was full value for the success. He'll be well treated if turned out before reassessment, even under a double penalty."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A lowly amateur jockeys' handicap confined to horses that hadn't won a Flat race this year, meaning few came here with compelling profiles and the main feature was a strong pace which saw those to the fore back out of things some way out. | [HORSE]: has dropped a fair way in the weights this year and looked back on song, ridden with more restraint than can often be the case, though still finding himself in front a long way out in a well-run race; mid-field, headway out wide 4f out, led 3f out, ridden when hung right over 1f out, headed final 1f, kept on; one to keep an eye on from this reduced mark."
"3rd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: This isn't a handicap from which to draw firm conclusions, the field staying towards the far rail in the straight and things getting very congested, most of the field meeting trouble at some point to one degree or another, the steady gallop just exacerbating matters and also placing the emphasis on speed, 3 of the first 4 home all stepping up in trip, Perfect Part, Eve's Boy and Gallant topping the list of those who looked unlucky on the day. | [HORSE]: was one of just a few to get a clean run round but this still rates a fine effort on his first try at the trip."
"Won | [RACE]: A useful and competitive handicap run at a sound gallop, despite tearaway-leader Antagonize being ignored by the rest of the field, one of the 3-y-os advancing his form to pull a little way clear of a clutch of rivals, most of whom had some solid recent form to their name; there was a headwind, putting those who saw daylight from an early stage at a disadvantage. | [HORSE]: got plenty of cover in a race run at a a good gallop and swept through to win a shade cosily. Her recent efforts over this trip had hinted that she could win a race of this nature and this was run to suit."
"Won | [RACE]: A typical Windsor sprint handicap with a few not seen to best advantage, notably the gambled-on favourite, though the form still has a solid enough look to it with the frame filled predominately by in-form/consistent types. | [HORSE]: back under a fully-fledged rider, produced a career best as she recorded a first handicap success, the return to even quicker conditions possibly the catalyst; mid-field, headway when short of room approaching 2f out, got gap over 1f out, led final 1f, asserted final 100 yds; should remain competitive if faced with similar conditions."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful handicap in which the errant leader caused things to get a bit messy in the straight even as the field fanned right out, a trio from the back coming through to be nicely on top of the rest at the line, probably best to tread a shade carefully with the bare form. | [HORSE]: not only seemed better than ever but shaped well into the bargain, finishing well having had to wait for room; in rear, had to wait for gap from 2f out, kept on well final 1f, took second final 50 yds, finished with running left; one to look out for."
"5th of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: Little to separate 3 of the three-year-olds through the latter stages of a lowly handicap in which several spoilt their chance by racing freely, there having been very little pace in the race until Miss Raincloud carted her way to the front after 2f. | [HORSE]: in first-time blinkers, looked set to be a big threat 1f out but didn't see a lot of room in the final furlong and failed to pick up."
"Won | [RACE]: A fair handicap short on potential but it was given a solid enough look by those in the frame, the 6th catching the eye further back; the pace was on the modest side. | [HORSE]: had run well in defeat here on her previous two starts, especially last time when she had a tough trip, but she's a tricky mare who needs things to fall just right. Darragh Keenan took over this time, and he rode a fine race, smuggling her into contention in the straight and delivering her to lead in the final yards. She deserved this second win, and it won't be the handicapper's reaction that stops her from adding to her tally."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap run at a sound gallop, one that still had plenty to do turning in staying on well to collar one that's shaping up well of late. | [HORSE]: tanked his way into the lead and didn't stop, but the line didn't come in time. The 4yo can surely double his tally this season."
"3rd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap which changed complexion in the final 1f, the hold-up horses getting into it with the winner getting a clearer run down the outer than some. | [HORSE]: , making a quick reappearance having run at Chelmsford less than 24 hours earlier, didn't get the clearest of runs in the straight but she finished well."
"7th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: An unsatisfactory apprentice contest, the majority of the field electing to come stand side after a couple of furlongs, while the runner-up stayed far side, the winner collaring that one having stayed in the centre before drifting towards him late on, the bare form obviously best treated with caution. | [HORSE]: was well backed but struggled to get involved, admittedly having raced in the unfavoured main group; raced off the pace, ridden under 2f out, never landed a blow."
"7th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A modest contest run at a muddling gallop, but at least hte interesting ones came to the fore, the first 2 worth marking up in coming from the back. | [HORSE]: was far from disgraced considering he gave them all a head start leaving the stalls, and then on the first bend rounded the field to take up the running. He paid for that later on."
"3rd of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A low-grade event with Comedian Leader gaining a first win on turf after some creditable recent efforts on the all-weather. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden, shaped better than the bare result after being left with far too much to do from the off; missed the break, soon detached, headway when carried left over 1f out, kept on, never nearer; this isn't the first time he's let himself down at the start, though, so he's probably not one to go overboard about."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 0-60 contested by mostly exposed sorts, but it was run at a true tempo and produced a good timefigure, so it looks reliable form for the grade. | [HORSE]: is threatening to come good soon, seemingly well positioned the way this was run but her rider seeming a touch shy in making her effort, though she's probably not a straightforward ride in fairness; waited with, no room briefly around 3f out, effort only over 1f out, ran on; she seems up to winning something similar."
"12th of 17, well beaten | [RACE]: The time was slightly quicker than the following class 4 but it was achieved in very different style, this far more steadily run, helping to explain why one who's spent most of his career over shorter was able to score with a degree of comfort; those held up were at a clear disadvantage, the favourite doing best of them in fourth. | [HORSE]: can have this run ignored; slowly into stride, in rear, hampered around halfway, held when carried left under 2f out, had a hopeless task from position."
"Won | [RACE]: With one of the joint-favourites pulling her chance away, this set up nicely for the other, Ey Up He's A Star ridden with plenty of confidence and scoring with something to spare. | [HORSE]: had hit the front too soon when edged out on his only previous visit here and with his rider at pains not to make the same mistake again, showed improved form to get off the mark in eye-catching fashion; waited with, travelled strongly, smooth progress from halfway, shaken up inside final 1f, asserted final 100 yds, won cosily; this kind of set up is going to play to his strengths and he'll be high on the shortlist under a penalty here next week."
"4th of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap to be relatively positive about, the winner following up at the expense of an improver and the third and fourth shaped well from the rear, too. | [HORSE]: gelded since last seen, shaped well despite still appearing rough around the edges making handicap debut after 8 weeks off, coming home well once he got the hang of things; held up, pushed along 3f out, headway out wide when hung left 1f out, ran on, nearest at the finish; well bred and remains with potential."
"7th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The winner set a sound pace, and though little got involved, no reason to think he's flattered by this, pulling clear with the favourite who is a recent winner. | [HORSE]: failed to repeat last effort, his draw and start scuppering any chance of that; slowly into stride, never involved, minimal assistance from saddle."
"Won | [RACE]: A decidedly low-grade handicap, and the result might have been slightly different had the runner-up not veered off a true line late on. | [HORSE]: had the run of the race and returned to form back on a sound surface under a well-judged ride with the blinkers back on to replace the visor. Things wouldn't be certain to play out as well next time."
"22nd of 29, well beaten | [RACE]: Year-on-year this proves to be one of the most competititve 3-y-o handicaps, the number of last-time-out winners in double figures, with a few of those chasing hat-tricks and generally progressive sorts aplenty, though there's a suspicion this may not prove one of the strongest renewals in recent times, with improvers in short supply on the day and very few marking themselves out as pattern race performers of the future, the winner a very obvious exception, his burst to the front and then second kick inside the final 1f giving him the air of one destined for bigger things; the field raced in 3 distinct groups, with the far side group in front much of the way, though the leaders there probably overdid it and the principals came from the other groups, the pair who pulled a little way clear racing in the centre, while the next 4 home all raced stand side. | [HORSE]: is probably best excused this run, seemingly doing too much at the head of a group who didn't fare well in general; raced far side, led overall, took strong hold, headed 2f out, weakened."
"13th of 15, well beaten | [RACE]: Rarely are competitive sprint handicaps broken apart by a winner as this was by a big improver, Desperate Hero bursting well clear of a group who finished in the sort of bunch that might ordinarily feature the winner of one of these rather than those competing for a place, the overall level of competition shy of the feature Scottish Stewards' Cup here but the winning performance not remotely out of place in such a conversation, the other pace having long since collapsed just as Desperate Hero was motoring further clear; the field split into 2 rough groups but neither seemed at an advantage with the pace true in both. | [HORSE]: was backed at long odds but put in his place back up in grade; in touch, ridden halfway, left behind."
"4th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A competitive race for grade in which the winner showed a willing attitude to see off a pair coming from much further back, the race developing towards the stand side with a few not seen to best effect. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form and is well worth another go over this still longer trip; dwelt, waited with, travelled as well as any, effort when short of room 2f out, headway when got gap over 1f out, no chance final 1f with race developing on other side of track."
"7th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A low-grade event, the class-dropping favourite just holding on from an in-form sort. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect, though wasn't threatening when finding trouble; slowly into stride, raced wide/off the pace, headway halfway, ridden over 3f out, beaten when snatched up over 1f out, not persevered with."
"12th of 29, fairly beaten | [RACE]: With results earlier in the week suggesting little in the way of a consistent bias, the majority rode mainly to their draws, 4 individual groups initially which became 3 from halfway, those racing on either wing seeming to get the worst of it as the action unfolded down the centre, Witch Hunter sweeping through from right out the back, with the other principals also coming from the second half of the field. | [HORSE]: 'won' the race in the stands' side group, doing okay considering he was 22lb higher than when last in a handicap (blew his mark having finished a close fourth in a Haydock Group 3 last time)."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap in which few got involved despite the gallop set by the winner being a sound one, the front 2 filling those positions throughout. | [HORSE]: was slowly away and took a good while to find his stride, handing the rest a big head start. He still only had the tailed-off outsider behind him approaching the final furlong but he stayed on well to grab fourth, and with a clean start he would surely have gone close."
"2nd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: A strongly-run race despite the small field, which certainly suited the first 2, the one that forced the gallop finishing third but subsequently disqualified for her rider weighing in light. | [HORSE]: ran his best race in handicaps refitted with headgear and returned to a shorter trip, though it all looked rather hard work in something of a slow-motion finish; waited with, went in snatches, driven over 3f out, switched over 1f out, carried head bit awkwardly, kept on final 1f."
"6th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair fillies' contest, Carlton and Co circumnavigating the field via the far side of the track and coming out on top in a blanket finish that saw the ninth horse home beaten less than 2 lengths. | [HORSE]: making all-weather/handicap debut, caught the eye after 9 months off and looks one to bear in mind for a similar event; raced off the pace, ridden over 2f out, late headway; will stay 1m."
"9th of 15, fairly beaten | [RACE]: This has the makings of strong form, a progressive 3-y-o leading home a pair of the 4 last-time-out winners - which included last year's victor - with plenty of in-form sorts also in attendance, the timefigure supporting a positive view. | [HORSE]: had no excuses dropped back in trip/grade; handy, driven under 3f out, beaten 2f out."
"6th of 25, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly typical Sandringham in make up, around half the field handicap debutants, and it was one of those who looked an unlucky loser, Cajole faring best of the big group who raced centre-to-stand side but beaten by one of the quartet who stayed far side, that small group also accounting for the third home; further back there were a few others who seemed inconvenienced by how things unfolded, favourite Miss Nightfall high on that list. | [HORSE]: was well supported and caught the eye on this first outing over a mile, faring the best of those who attempted to come from off the pace. This was only her second run in handicaps and there's probably more to come."
"Won | [RACE]: This proved quite an attritional handicap given the sound gallop, deep surface and headwind in the straight, and one who has been plying his trade on the all-weather this winter came out on top, the next 3 home all likely to be of more interest in the coming weeks for one reason or another. | [HORSE]: got the well-run race that suits and duly turned in his best effort of the season to capitalise on a reduced mark; mid-field, headway under 4f out, forced wide home turn, led over 1f out, forged clear; did this quite well but had the benefit of some recent runs under his belt (next 3 home were all making their reappearance), which probably counted for plenty given the headwind and slow conditions, and he showed his vulnerability off marks in the low 80s last year."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that produced a dramatic finish, a 4-way photo, with the judge unable to split a couple of them, both Embour and After John bouncing back from a spell in the doldrums. | [HORSE]: after 6 weeks off, got back on the up, doing well under the circumstances, easily best of those close up with the other 3 in the photo all coming from well off the pace; led, pushed along 2f out, headed inside final 100 yds, kept on."
"13th of 16, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Morning going stick readings suggested the ground was quicker on the stand side than the rest of the course and that seemed to be borne out by the result to what looked a competitive sprint handicap, the first 3 all from a select group of 4 that stuck to the rail, the rest having come down the centre with the field converging about 2f out. | [HORSE]: should have been suited by going back up in trip, but ran poorly having raced indolently; slowly into stride, in rear, soon off bridle, never involved."
"22nd of 27, well beaten | [RACE]: A typically strong running of the Buckingham Palace, the meeting all the better for its reintroduction in 2020, but for the third year in a row it was dominated by those drawn high, the action unfolding right up the near rail, much like in the Britannia over an hour earlier, the winner seen to something like maximum effect for all this Group-class effort has foundation, felt good enough to contest the Jersey at this meeting last year and one of a number to reap the benefit of a switch from the retired Sir Michael Stoute into a new yard this year. | [HORSE]: was below his best tried in cheekpieces, and did run moderately in the Cambridgeshire, so perhaps massive fields aren't what he enjoys, although that was on soft ground."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A pair of well-backed nursery debutants pulled clear but this is still probably form to treat with some degree of caution with high draws dominating and the stand rail looking the place to be, as has been the case here for the majority of the season, the low-drawn Ninety Nine better than the result implies. | [HORSE]: under more testing conditions, settled better than has been the case returned to sprinting and showed improved form switched to nurseries having been strong in the betting; better drawn than most, prominent, led under 3f out, ridden 2f out, headed final 50 yds, pulled clear of remainder."
"8th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A useful handicap but probably muddling form, the field bunched at the line and a few meeting trouble, the winner doing well to overcome the worst of it and both Summer of Love and Boardman better than they were able to show. | [HORSE]: is a while without a win on turf and wasn't disgraced; prominent, pushed along over 3f out, shuffled back over 1f out, not quicken."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A one-sided handicap, the winner controlling things from the front, most of the remainder finishing in a bit of a heap. | [HORSE]: whose last two wins came over this C&D off higher marks, performed well, keeping on steadily in the straight having been trapped wide turning in. He's one for the notebook."
"Won | [RACE]: A big-field sprint handicap that was dominated by those drawn low, the winner making all to hold off the in-form favourite with the fourth Roberto Caro the biggest eye-catcher as the only one from the wider-drawn group to get near the principals. | [HORSE]: back in a visor, got back on the up to notch a fifth win for the yard, all of them coming under this apprentice, who soon took the initiative and sent his mount forward on a day where such positive tactics paid dividends; raced far side, made all, ridden when tackled over 1f out, edged left last ½f, kept on."
"5th of 19, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful big-field sprint that looks sure to provide plenty of clues for similar races in the next few weeks; the field split into 2 groups, those drawn 12 and below seen to better effect than those high, the first and third up there throughout and split by a strong finisher with several from the other side sure to be at least as interesting next time, Physique a big eye-catcher on his debut for a new stable while Glenfinnan and Trilby both shaping much better than their mid-field placings might suggest. | [HORSE]: had won this race last year off a similar preparation and shaped as if still in good form, undone by a 4 lb higher mark/racing in the disadvantaged group; prominent, pushed along 2f out, rider briefly dropped reins inside final 1f, kept on."
"7th of 16, competitive | [RACE]: Loads to pick out of this competitive handicap for the grade, the winner reappearing with an excellent effort having raced wide throughout, his trip not the negative it might have been given the bumping and barging that went on behind him in the straight, 5 meeting notable trouble. | [HORSE]: back in headgear, ran respectably over 3f longer trip, not seen to best effect; mid-field, ridden when hampered early in straight, not quicken."
"Won | [RACE]: These came back well stretched despite the gallop being no more than fair, none of the patiently ridden ones able to get competitive and the form probably worth treating with a pinch of salt, the first 2 hugging the favoured far rail all the way up the home straight. | [HORSE]: has had more obvious opportunities to get off the mark and it's not that clear why he was able to do it this time, and in such emphatic fashion, too, racing close up against the far rail maybe even more of an advantage than usual at this track; chased leaders, went on over 2f out, responded well; his previous record suggests banking on him to run to a similar level next time may be unwise."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap run at a modest pace, the winner never far away and capitalising on a falling mark to foil the well-backed second, who didn't look overly keen. | [HORSE]: well backed, fared better than of late in first-time blinkers after just 7 days off, but didn't look keen under pressure so it remains to be seen if he backs this up; tracked pace, pushed along 2f out, challenged 1f out, hung left, carried head awkwardly, kept on."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A pace collapse saw a couple of hold-up horses coming to the fore on the far flank, with the third and fourth worth extra credit for differing reasons. | [HORSE]: built on her Windsor third, getting going late following a slow start. She's done well since the introduction of a tongue-tie and isn't far away from making the breakthrough."
"4th of 6, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Rule 4: 10p in £ applies t all sps A messy race, in which the tempo lifted only over 3f out, only the winner really handling the track, a cautious view of the form advised. | [HORSE]: looked to have been given a stiff mark for his handicap debut and he did much better than on his return, running creditably, though without looking at home on the track; held up, pushed along 3f out, carried head bit awkwardly and looked ill at ease 2f out, not quicken final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: A useful sprint handicap in which the field raced in 2 groups, the 5 lowest stalls racing more towards the far side and filling 4 of the first 5 places, Cooperation deserving plenty of credit in coming out best of those who came from the other side. | [HORSE]: confirmed the promise of his reappearance effort with first-time cheekpieces fitted alongside his usual hood, the way he went through this suggesting there's still some untapped potential despite him being a 6-y-o; chased leader, travelled well, pushed along under 2f out, led over 1f out, idled, driven out; a 5 lb penalty gives him a squeak of getting into the Wokingham, but the handicapper is unlikely to put him up by much and a return to Newcastle on Northumberland Plate day for the race he won last year looks an ideal target near to hand."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap run at just an ordinary gallop which resulted in a tight finish, the first 2 home doing well under the circumstances given they were both dropped out, the runner-up meeting trouble and arguably a bit unlucky. | [HORSE]: ran well after 5 months off to prove he's still fully effective on turf and was arguably a shade unlucky not to snap a losing sequence stretching back to 2020; dwelt, held up, headway when had to wait for gap 2f out, got gap final 1f, challenged final 50 yds, just failed, conceded first run; he's lower in the weights on this surface compared to all-weather and is one to bear in mind under similar conditions."
"5th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap taken by an in-form filly who attracted support, no real exuses for those in the frame, though Khabib a little further back got no room to work with and is one to keep an eye on. | [HORSE]: back on turf after 3 months off, was unlucky not to finish closer, his current mark clearly still a workable one; in touch, denied a run over 1f out, finished with running left."
"Won | [RACE]: An ordinary nursery run at a strong pace, which helped the winner come from last to first up the stand rail. | [HORSE]: who'd run to RPRs in excess of her official mark on each of her last three starts, was taken off her feet at halfway, but she's a strong stayer at this trip and quickly settled matters once getting to the front entering the final half-furlong. This was a belated first success, but she's yet to try 6f and the way she races suggests she could well improve for it."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: Plenty of deadwood in this, only the first 4 of any real interest on the day and in the future and the draw played a part, the field strung out wide across the track and those drawn high typically struggled here, the fourth probably the most interesting for next time with that in mind. | [HORSE]: up another 5lb and on the hat-trick bid following two Yarmouth wins, remains in good form and deserves upgrading for making his challenge further away from the first three home. He's versatile ground-wise and can continue to progress."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair 3-y-o handicap run at a modest pace, the well-backed winner never far from the action and fending off one who resumed progress back on all-weather. | [HORSE]: freshened up after runs in successive days early last month, is still on a winning mark if he applies himself better, going down only narrowly despite persistently hanging left under pressure. He repeated the level of his C&D success two starts earlier in defeat."
"3rd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair fillies' handicap fought out by a pair of Loves, Thunderous always keeping Kiss Me My at bay inside the final furlong. | [HORSE]: had been raised 3 lb for a recent course win and although she ran creditably, can have this run overlooked, on the back foot from the get go; hampered leaving stalls then stumbled having clipped heels, raced centre, in rear, headway when switched 2f out, pushed along soon after, not quicken final 1f."
"6th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that was run at a strong gallop, those drawn low going off too hard and setting it up for a pair of closers that opted for different paths, Garfield Shadow sneaking up the inner and just holding off one forced wider. | [HORSE]: has slipped in the weights and ran as well as could be expected; held up, took strong hold, shaken up over 2f out, switched inside early in straight, late headway."
"7th of 18, well beaten | [RACE]: A very competitive and well-run event though, as can be the case at this track, it proved hard to come from too far back, Kihavah landing the prize for the second year in a row, a pair of 4-y-os and an unexposed sort filling the frame to give the form a solid look, one backed up by the clock, whilst a few in behind are better than they could show for one reason or another, most notably Real Terms who found trouble after the field had elected to come stand side. | [HORSE]: one of the least exposed, seemed to have plenty going for him but, back up in trip/under less testing conditions and in first-time hood, had no excuses on this occasion (also easy to back); steadied at the start, mid-division, ridden entering straight, steady progress 2f out, hung left 1f out, never a threat."
"5th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A good-quality 3-y-o sprint and it should produce winners of similar events over the coming weeks, with the unlucky-in-running second the chief eyecatcher. | [HORSE]: shaped as if better for the run after 6 months off, the drop in trip probably against him as well remembering he won a well-contested 6f nursery in the mud at Goodwood last summer, his mark still a fair one judged on that effort; mid-division, met some trouble 2f out, outpaced briefly, rallied final 1f."
"8th of 19, competitive | [RACE]: A valuable sprint handicap and strong-looking form, acknowledging the now-typical York draw bias was at play, those drawn high largely struggling to get involved and the efforts of Strike Red and Arctic Thunder worth marking up given their position on the near side. | [HORSE]: was bidding to make it 4 wins in as many weeks but had more to do at the weights; raced far side, disputed lead, went on 2f out, headed approaching final 1f, weakened gradually."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap which saw the winner have it all his own way, dictating matters and always fending off the challenge of the inconvenienced favourite. | [HORSE]: shaped better than the bare result and can finally find a race in this country from this mark granted a proper pace to chase; slowly into stride, in rear, ridden 2f out, switched 1f out, stayed on, nearest at the finish, would have benefited from a stronger gallop."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: This got a little messy late on with a couple inconvenienced, most notably the second, but she'd still have struggled to match the improved winner, who quickened up nicely from off the pace on just second start for a new yard. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect and would have got closer to the winner if things had panned out better, though it's something of a stretch to suggest she'd have beaten that one; awkward leaving stalls, in touch, had to wait for gap over 1f out, got gap final 1f, kept on."
"2nd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: With less than a length separating the quintet, this looks form to treat with caution, Wreck It Ryley well positioned down the outer in a steadily-run affair. | [HORSE]: was well backed into odds-on favouritism and again ran well returned to a sounder surface, especially given how headstrong he was for the first half of the contest; mid-division, not settle fully, headway on inner 2f out, bit short of room and became unbalanced but managed to squeeze through gap over 1f out, led entering final 1f, kept on well inside final 1f, headed close home."
"5th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: A weak handicap in which the winner was well ridden from the front and never looked in much danger once upping the tempo again rounding the home turn. | [HORSE]: was sent off an amazingly short price for a 21-race maiden who has looked to be a short-runner and, despite the drop in class, he again finished weakly."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap which saw a 3-y-o improver that looked far from the finished article work his way to the front after a couple of furlongs and find plenty to get off the mark at the expense of a couple of solid older rivals. | [HORSE]: looked a thorough stayer in getting off the mark on handicap debut, needing plenty of riding in first-time cheekpieces but finding a lot when challenged in the straight and going away again at the line; slowly into stride, led after 2f, ridden over 3f out, joined briefly 1f out, kept on well; is a long way from living up to his price tag but a step up to staying trips will surely see him improve further."
"8th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The first 3 from the Spring Cup headed the market, with the runner-up then a short price to go one better, that one disappointing but the form upheld by the other pair, this race overall looking solid, the time comparing well with that for the Lockinge 70 minutes earlier; the field raced as more-or-less 3 groups until 3f out, the best pace on the stand side, the first 2 racing off the pace on the far side until being switched to the stand side as the groups merged. | [HORSE]: very smart at his best in Hong Kong (raced there as Glorious Dragon) for P. C. Ng, was below the pick of his form last year having first start for 6 months and first in Britain since 2018, keener than ideal minus his usual tongue strap; steadied at the start, raced centre, not settle fully, tracked pace after 2f, ridden over 2f out, weakened."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A well-run race which set up better for those from off the pace than typically over this C&D, Jannas Journey quickly bouncing back from a blip as she made it 6 wins from her last 7 starts. | [HORSE]: caught the eye flashing home late from well back. This a welcome return to form, although he'll have to wait until 2026 for more opportunities at his beloved Carlisle."
"3rd of 8, competitive | [RACE]: A fair 3-y-o handicap that saw a bit of progression from the pair who came clear; the gallop was strong. | [HORSE]: fitted with tongue strap for handicap bow, was strong in the betting but didn't really get the chance to show what he could do, residual greenness at the start putting him on the back foot; dwelt, in rear, pushed along 3f out, late headway; clearly thought capable of better, a view supported by his pedigree and price tag."
"3rd of 11, competitive | [RACE]: Typically modest stuff for the grade, though the pace was sound with the field soon well strung out and the first 2 came clear; they came to the stands side in the straight, the winner getting the rail and forcing the runner-up to switch off it, which might have been crucial given the fine margin involved at the finish. | [HORSE]: is potentially thrown in on old form and deserves marking up for faring comfortably the best of those ridden patiently. He's one to bear in mind despite his advancing years."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Reasonable form between those in the places that included a pair of consistent types, as well as Kodiman who didn't get the rub of the green once more and may have gone close with a clear passage. | [HORSE]: hasn't had things go his way many times of late and, with hood disposed of after 6 weeks off, was unlucky not to finish closer after meeting interference at a crucial stage; waited with, shuffled back to rear when denied a run home turn, got gap early in straight, met some trouble soon after, progress 1f out, ran on; remains one to be interested in."
"3rd of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: This threw up an unusual result by any standards for a handicap, let alone a class 6 contested by older horses, and it's hard form to get a handle on, Wiseacre seemingly massively improved as he took his field apart. | [HORSE]: was flat to the boards in last and gong nowhere when the winner went for home, but he did consent to rally in the straight and snatched an unlikely place. He's not won in over two years and has looked a hard ride in recent starts."
"6th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: A messy race, several suffering in-running trouble and the pace failing to hold up, the veteran of the field swooping late to land the spoils and the third unlucky not to win; high draws were at an advantage, the first 3 all drawn in double figures. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect, shaping as if back in form but one of several that had a troubled passage; slowly into stride, raced off the pace, no room over 1f out, headway when switched inside final 1f, no extra late on."
"19th of 21, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful event that was well-contested, although it was highly affected by the draw, those who came from stalls 1-5 all making the first 6 with the fast-finishing but quirky Kitaab best of those from double-figures as the field fanned out across the track; it lacked unexposed sorts bar the favourite who seemed to find the race coming too soon, a well-weighted veteran picked off late in the day by one at the top of his game. | [HORSE]: followed a below-par effort with an even worse one, beaten by much more than the draw; always behind."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A couple of unexposed ones alongside some solid handicappers means this may prove a bit stronger than many races of this grade in the coming weeks. | [HORSE]: might have been easy to back returning after 6 months off without any headgear but ran really well, and looks likely to be winning more races this year; mid-field, quickened to lead around 2f out, collared by race-fit rival final 50 yds; one to be interested in."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap which few got into, the pair who fought out the finish essentially getting first run on the field with the pace having steadied before halfway. | [HORSE]: ran at least as well in defeat as when winning the time before, possibly a little unlucky with the winner having lugged across her twice, the stewards unable to be completely satisfied that the interference had affected the result, though; prominent, travelled well, challenged over 1f out, bumped soon after, carried right briefly inside final 1f, ran on."
"Won | [RACE]: A low-grade nursery but both the winner and fourth improved for a step up in trip and did well after meeting trouble at various stages, albeit having both been held up in a strongly-run race. | [HORSE]: showed improved form to get off the mark making nursery debut over 1f longer trip, doing well under the circumstances; hampered start, in rear, ridden over 3f out, headway when short of room over 1f out, switched final 1f, stayed on to lead well inside final 1f, edged left, won readily; in good hands and may do better still."
"3rd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: Trouble in running played its part in this handicap and there was only one runner under the age of 6 in the line up, but Cosmos Raj has been consistent of late and came from the rear to resume winning ways, getting a clearer passage than the trio that chased him home. | [HORSE]: had his conditions and returned to form on this third run for the yard, despite being short of room in the closing stages (looked to cost him second place). He's suited by a good gallop on this sort of ground and is on a tempting mark."
"4th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap run at a steady gallop, which resulted in the field being well bunched for a long way and some trouble in running, but the principals can still be viewed positively, the first 2 home progressive 3-y-os whilst the third and fourth are below their last winning marks and the fifth did best of those held up. | [HORSE]: wasted no time getting back to form; mid-field, travelled fluently, had to wait for gap under 3f out, pushed along 2f out, kept on; he's below his last winning mark and eligible for lesser races, so can't be written off."
"5th of 10, competitive | [RACE]: Quick conditions and a wind from behind meant the emphasis was firmly on speed in this useful sprint handicap, Get It able to dominate, lowering Blue Point's course record in the process, with the placed pair among his closest pursuers throughout, Dorney Lake shaping a fair bit better than the bare form as a result. | [HORSE]: is better judged on his reappearance form for now, struggling to pick up the pace setters under these conditions; mid-field, pushed along over 2f out, one paced."
"6th of 16, competitive | [RACE]: A decidely useful handicap in which the first 3 pulled clear with a bunched finish for minor honours, Rohaan finally able to capitalise on a falling mark at a track that suits so well, needing the gaps but sneaking up the near rail in a style reminiscent of last year's Wokingham success. | [HORSE]: continues in good heart, value for finishing a bit closer given where he ended up having to challenge; held up, headway out wide over 2f out, plugged on, not ideally placed."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A rather messy nursery run at a strong pace, the winner and second both benefiting from biding their time early, though some other patiently ridden ones met serious trouble as the pace-forcers started to backpedal. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, shaped similarly to last time, again looking the winner 2f out but caught late, this time paying for making his effort earlier than ideal; close up, travelled best, led over 1f out, headed final 100 yds, no extra; he's clearly up to winning a nursery when more goes his way."
"7th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A day of celebration for Franny Norton's retirement from the saddle couldn't be dampened by the poor weather that saw this final race delayed by 20 minutes and started without stalls, an air of inevitability about the result in a race that saw a few hamstrung by the flag start and others by the worsening ground. | [HORSE]: possibly still needed this run after a further 7 weeks off, best not judged too harshly on this the way it went in any case; slowly into stride, in rear, labouring over 3f out."
"4th of 16, competitive | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap that was taken apart by one making his debut in this sphere, Isle of Jura set to win by several lengths until heavily eased and clearly one to follow as he climbs the ranks; the frame was completed by a couple who arrived in good form and Outgun, who would probably have finished second granted a clear run, this trio, along with the timefigure, adding weight to the idea this is strong form. | [HORSE]: again shaped better than the bare result; slowly into stride, in rear, went with enthusiasm, no room over 2f out and kept running up blind alleys until finally getting gap final 1f, good headway late on and finished with running left; remains open to improvement and has done enough to suggest he has races in him off this sort of mark when things drop right, so one to bear in mind."
"Won | [RACE]: The pattern on the afternoon for coming stand side in the straight was well established by this race and a high draw was a help as a result, those that raced more towards the centre from low draws knowing their fate a long way out. | [HORSE]: a winner on soft at Windsor in August off 75, again showed his preference for ease underfoot and ran on well to provide his trainer with a landmark victory. This was the first time he's been ridden by anyone other than John Fahey and his rider's 7lb claim very likely proved crucial."
"10th of 21, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful sprint in which they split into 2 groups, stalls 1-8 racing middle-to-far side but it was the bigger group and those drawn higher that held sway over C&D for a change, recent winner Tiriac just edging out one who had gone close in a similarly big field at Ascot the time before; the pace was a strong one, some quirky types that made some late inroads best not given too much credit. | [HORSE]: shaped similarly to last time; slowly into stride, raced off the pace, pushed along before halfway, ran on, merely passed beaten horses; he's essentially easy enough to take on."
"3rd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A standard handicap for the level, the winner dropping in grade and edging out one that has been in good form recently, Ultramarine shaping well back in third. | [HORSE]: not for the first time shaped well under this inexperienced rider and he's down to a handy mark; dwelt, held up, headway when not clear run 2f out, keeping on when hung right final 1f, short of room close home, finished with running left; one to keep an eye on and will prove suited by a return to 7f."
"Won | [RACE]: The pair that contested the lead finished well beaten in this useful handicap, the winner coming from a little off the gallop having had to chart a passage through traffic, the runner-up catching the eye with how he finished off, too. | [HORSE]: bounced back to form with headgear removed, able to lie up with them this time and coming through well after having had to briefly wait to launch her challenge; dwelt, in touch, effort when not clear run over 1f out, got gap final 1f, stayed on to lead inside final 100 yds."
"Won | [RACE]: All bar 2 of them were covered by 5 lengths at the line in a far cry from Gold Cup-bound Vauban's rout the previous season but that isn't to say this year's Copper Horse was free of similarities by any means, as a Mullins-trained market principal making his first start on the Flat for his all-conquering yard added another big race to his trainer's cross-code tally, most of the others exposed as befitting one of the Royal Ascot handicaps restricted to older horses; the pace was strong, lifting further through the final 5f, which reflects well on a runner-up whose bid for home saw her keep all bar the unexposed winner at bay, plenty of others closing up all too late and possibly made to look better than they shaped. | [HORSE]: gave Willie Mullins his second successive win in this and tenth Royal Ascot success in all, another advert for the yard if any more were needed having stalled at the end of his time with David Menuisier, sharpened up by a highly impressive hurdling debut first time back (when also tongue tied) and showing plenty of stamina where his stablemate had blown it apart through speed in 2023, a return to something like the sort of form that had seen him win at listed level during a progressive 4-y-o campaign; settled in mid-division, he had to be shaken up entering the straight but closed relentlessly if gradually, nosing to the front approaching the final 100 yds and driven a little way clear; there are races like the Ebor - another achievement already on his trainer's CV thanks to Sesenta in 2009 and Absurde last year - that would be likely targets but his real untapped potential lies as a hurdler, with his age hopefully encouraging some ambitious campaigning."
"11th of 14, well beaten | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap that went the way of a well-treated veteran enjoying a winter revival. | [HORSE]: in a change of headgear, was much too free and appears to have completely lost his way; missed the break, mid-field, pulled way to front over 5f out, headed over 2f out, weakened."
"Won | [RACE]: Useful form from the pair that fought out a very tight finish, a lightly-raced improver for a new yard edging out one that was well backed for a thriving stable; the pace quickened early in the straight and the first 2 came from the rear. | [HORSE]: showed improved form to come out on top on first outing since leaving Marcus Tregoning after 5 months off, getting up narrowly back down in trip on the back of a breathing operation; held up, good headway over 1f out, challenged final 1f, stayed on to lead post; lightly raced for age and has more to come granted a sustained period of racing for new yard."
"13th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: A modestly-run 0-60 in which a couple pulled their chance away and the 2 recent winners deserve credit for finishing comfortably on top of the prominent brigade, the winner haivng been brought right to the stand rail in the latter stages. | [HORSE]: without the headgear this time, bolted to post and really shouldn't have been allowed to take part, his race run before it started; dwelt, in rear, left behind when hung right over 3f out."
"11th of 30, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The Britannia so often proves the hottest ticket in town so far as 3-y-o handicaps go and, for all this year's running failed to throw up one who looks a nailed-on Group performer, the overall form looks as rock solid as ever, the winner a handicap debutant and 7 of the next 8 home arriving on the back of victories in such races, the odd one out being a runner-up who could easily have won had things worked out a little better on the day, an overall time that was the quickest since Roca Tumu came out on top in 2013 adding further substance; all bar the 4 drawn highest raced in one group down the centre, the quartet to race on the stand side up against it pretty much from the outset. | [HORSE]: travelled well, as had been the case when winning at Naas, but the 7lb rise in a much deeper race proved beyond him."
"14th of 14, well beaten | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap that set up well for those ridden with just a touch of patience, the well-backed third the only one of those up with the early gallop to still be around in the finish. | [HORSE]: 4lb well in under a penalty for his Musselburgh win, has won on Tapeta but never travelled at any stage on his first outing at this venue. He's been in good form so will probably be worth another chance."
"Won | [RACE]: A fair handicap that was run at a strong pace, the first 6 pulling well clear, with the winner doing notably well given he was up there throughout, the other 5 all coming from mid-field or even further back. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, was turned out again quickly and wasted no time getting back to form as he got off the mark for new connections, returning to the level he showed last autumn for James Fanshawe, value for extra having been the only one at the finish who raced up with the strong pace; led, shaken up home turn, driven under 2f out, closed down inside final 1f, all out to hold on."
"8th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A run-of-the-mill handicap that produced a blanket finish. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, took a step forward with doing enough to suggest she can take advantage of this opening mark; in rear, kept on, never landed a blow."
"6th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A competitive race for the grade and form that should prove solid, a pair of 3-y-os coming to the fore, while a couple of hold-up horses shaped well from the back on their returns; visibility was reduced due to fog. | [HORSE]: returns to all-weather on an attractive mark (last 4 wins on all-weather, including from 8 lb higher back in April) and shaped better than the bare result after 10 weeks off; held up, headway over 1f out, kept on, not knocked about, left with a lot to do; will prove suited by a return to 1¼m+ and is one to keep an eye on."
"9th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: The stable-switching favourite flopped in this low-grade sprint, 9-y-o Gilt Edge not for catching when kicking clear on the home bend. | [HORSE]: went without his usual tongue tie and can have this run overlooked after 8 weeks off (had breathing operation in interim), colliding with the rail early and suffering some interference turning in; mid-field, ridden when short of room over 2f out, not recover."
"8th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: This was turned into a procession by the bang-in-form Another Baar, who was shouldering a double penalty but completed the 4-timer in facile fashion once again. | [HORSE]: was amiss, reported to have bled from the nose; awkward leaving stalls, handy, folded from 2f out."
"Won | [RACE]: They might have finished in a bit of a bunch behind the winner but there are reasons for thinking that this should prove pretty reliable form for the level, a number arriving in good heart and victory in a truly-run race going to the least-exposed one. | [HORSE]: benefited not only from having a top claimer on board but also a much more truly-run race than at Lingfield; in touch, went prominent under 3f out, led approaching last ½f, had bit in hand; her half-sister Plus Point has got form up to 2m this year and Beset may well have more to offer faced with a similarly true test at this trip or over a bit further."
"4th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A run-of-the-mill handicap - certainly for the track - with nothing even remotely progressive in sight; the pace was stronger than ideal, the winner coming from rear as the picture changed through the final 3f or so. | [HORSE]: is inclined to get going too late no matter what the trip and although he is more than capable off this mark, he isn't one to be getting carried away with."
"12th of 19, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A pair of outsiders filling the first 2 positions felt rather fitting considering the muddling nature of this year's Kensington Palace, as the complexion of a soundly-run race changed relay-style in the straight, the winner played last of the principals - and also widest of them - after others had trodden a similar path to get to the front briefly before she struck, any number on their inside not getting the gaps when needed as they returned very well clustered. | [HORSE]: can have a line put through this run, leaving the impression she should have finished closer; mid-division, smooth headway entering straight, denied a run soon after, not recover; she's worth another chance in her current vain of form."
"Won | [RACE]: A trio that had contested the Britannia, including the third and the fifth, took on 5 going up in grade, 3 of them handicap debutants, the Ascot third just prevailing over a 66/1-on Brighton winner, the latter bumping the former and earning his rider a 4-day ban, the race overall rather messy and the form possibly muddling; the field raced as one group up the centre after around 1f, the runner-up setting a fair tempo. | [HORSE]: well backed, comes from a stable in fine form and built on his good effort in the Britannia, doing well the way the race was run, likely to be of interest when he takes on older rivals given how he's progressing; slowly into stride, held up, headway 2f out, stayed on final 1f despite being carried right, led close home."
"Won | [RACE]: A competitive affair taken apart by the rejuvenated Tees Spirit who raced alone on the far side, an in-form pair from the remaining 2 groups that merged around 2f chasing him home, the timefigure suggesting that there are reasons to be positive regarding the form despite the winner’s possible advantage. | [HORSE]: whose yard has made a good start to the turf season, has an excellent record fresh and roared back to life after 6 months off, this his best effort since landing a listed race in 2022, showing blistering speed and having it in the bag from just after halfway, not the only winner on the card to make all, such tactics frequently rewarded here; raced solo far side, dominated, went with enthusiasm, went clear 2f out, closed down only final 100 yds; it's entirely possible that he was on the quickest part of the track and recent profile suggests that he's not an obvious type to follow up."
"5th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: The gallop for this handicap was on the steady side, but it still appeals as form to view quite positively, the winner capitalising on a much-reduced mark and chased home by a last-time-out scorer, whilst a couple further back offered something to work on as well. | [HORSE]: back on turf, after 9 weeks off, shaped better than the distance beaten suggests, to the extent this can be viewed as a return to the sort of form she showed over the winter; steadied at the start, in rear, travelled fluently, shaken up 2f out, burrowed up far rail soon after and was making good headway when no room and snatched up over 1f out, not recover."
"9th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: An open-looking handicap, plenty holding chances in the latter stages of a well-run race, the first 2 taking a drop in grade, having been mid-field in the International at Ascot last time. | [HORSE]: with blinkers replacing cheekpieces, ran poorly, application lacking, likely to be back to his last winning mark after this, though of little interest even so; waited with, ridden 3f out, dropped away over 1f out, looked none too keen."
"11th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: An apprentice handicap that was influenced by the apparent track bias that has been a strong feature of the races on the straight course here of late, the race once again unfolding under the near rail, those caught wider on the track best not judged too harshly as a result. | [HORSE]: had returned to form with a win over C&D last time and is best forgiven the run; prominent out wide, ridden 3f out, weakened quickly."
"7th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful fillies' handicap which saw the 3-y-os that dominated the betting form part of the 4 that came a long way clear of the rest, though the winner was ultimately much the best of that quartet and scored readily. | [HORSE]: travelled as if in some form before disconcertingly checking out very tamely; held up, good headway out wide 4f out, folded tamely 2f out."
"4th of 16, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap run at a sound gallop, the lightly-raced winner improved for a breathing operation and edging out one who will remain of interest in the coming weeks. | [HORSE]: got right back on track in a first-time visor, reeled in late having showed excellent pace against the far rail (which was an apparent advantage). He will likely benefit from a return to 6f."
"4th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A sprint handicap that looks shallow beyond those in the frame, the front-running winner capitalising on a reduced mark to get the better of the in-form favourite. | [HORSE]: was penalised for her win her 48 hours earlier and remains in decent form despite coming up short in her hat-trick bid, not seen entirely to best effect but hard to call her much better than the result; raced off the pace, no room 2f out, not clear run approaching 1f out, not quicken final 1f."
"9th of 14, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A competitive handicap featuring plenty of solid operators at this level and it should pay to be positive about the principals, though typically for a big field at the track there was a fair bit of messiness, with those held up struggling to land a blow and the strong favourite Mr Escobar coming home pretty much on the bridle after meeting trouble. | [HORSE]: , a well-backed favourite on his first run for Willie Mullins, seemed to be going best in the straight, but he was hanging and was soon eased out of contention, still not beaten far despite that. The stewards held an inquiry and Ryan Moore confirmed the horse was hanging badly left. If there's nothing seriously wrong with him, he has to be capable of better."
"Won | [RACE]: Not an especially strong race for the grade, certainly not chockful of in-form runners, but it produced a popular winner with a course specialist doing the job in a race which saw the pace hold up. | [HORSE]: turned in his best effort to notch a record-equalling eighth win at the track, in the process lowering his own course-record time. He'll be interesting back at this venue when allowed to dominate, though life will likely get tougher from here."
"5th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: An ordinary contest run at a stop-start gallop in which the first 3 occupied those positions throughout. | [HORSE]: was well supported but wasn't seen to best effect, held up in a race that suited those more forwardly ridden. He should do better when his stamina is more fully tested."
"10th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: Basement fare and the sole progressive sort in the line-up eventually got the job done with a fair amount to spare; the pace was steady with several racing freely, including the winner. | [HORSE]: had been gelded since last seen but was far too keen for his own good after 9 months upped 3f in trip; mid-field, pulled hard, dropped away quickly early in straight."
"28th of 29, well beaten | [RACE]: Year-on-year this proves to be one of the most competititve 3-y-o handicaps, the number of last-time-out winners in double figures, with a few of those chasing hat-tricks and generally progressive sorts aplenty, though there's a suspicion this may not prove one of the strongest renewals in recent times, with improvers in short supply on the day and very few marking themselves out as pattern race performers of the future, the winner a very obvious exception, his burst to the front and then second kick inside the final 1f giving him the air of one destined for bigger things; the field raced in 3 distinct groups, with the far side group in front much of the way, though the leaders there probably overdid it and the principals came from the other groups, the pair who pulled a little way clear racing in the centre, while the next 4 home all raced stand side. | [HORSE]: gave up his unbeaten record for the yard in rather tame fashion; raced stand side, raced off the pace, made no impression."
"6th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: The field split at an early stage, with Hodler, Outrun The Storm and Soar Above heading for the traditionally disadvantageous stand rail and the others more towards the centre, though the first-named did tack back across to that group around halfway, sticking at it without being to trouble one that was bouncing back from a reduced mark after a spell in the doldrums. | [HORSE]: once more wasn't seen to best effect, asked to hug the disadvantaged stand rail; raced stand side, made running, headed over 2f out, weakened."
"2nd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: The winner was always going best and was full value for her success - and possibly even a little more - but in edging across to the rail once in front she caused interference - either directly or indirectly - to 3 of her remaining 4 rivals, Ravenswell having in effect taken no part in the race. | [HORSE]: showed improved form when runner-up at Wetherby, appreciating the step up to 1m2f, and he built on that with another solid effort despite the race not really being run to suit. The son of Kingman can surely find a race before long."
"Won | [RACE]: A disappointing race for a number of reasons, including a particularly slow gallop, though that didn't stop the likeable winner coming from last, the bare form best rated quite conservatively all things considered. | [HORSE]: continues to be a credit to connections, this his sixth win from 17 starts for his current stable, building on his encouraging return and doing well under the circumstances given he'd resorted to his sluggish-starting ways in a race run at a crawl; very slowly away, in rear, steady headway from 3f out, stayed on to lead approaching last ½f; he's probably got more wins in him yet."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: The pace was just even in this fairly useful handicap, the advantage with the prominent racers and Grand Traverse hammered home his class edge under what might be close to his optimum conditions, the runner-up doing well given she was the only one to get involved from off the pace. | [HORSE]: after 3 months off, was fitted with a hood having been too keen on her first 2 starts this year and ran well on form, deserving extra credit as the only one who came from off the pace to get involved; held up, effort early in straight, headway over 2f out, switched over 1f out, kept on well, took second close home; she's perhaps not completely straightforward, but has the ability to be winning off this sort of mark."
"8th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: Not the deepest race for the money on offer, that, coupled with the fact that it was a start-stop gallop which resulted in those being held up being at a disadvantage - Dark Moon Rising faring best on that front - meaning that it probably won't prove as strong as most handicaps at this meeting, for all that the trio of last-time-out winners made the frame; the first 2 had it to themselves from 2f out, Per Contra carrying the progressive winner across the track late on which enabled the main pack to close again in what became a bunched finish. | [HORSE]: had pulled clear with a potential pattern performer at Goodwood and shaped as if still in good form back against his elders from a 7-lb higher mark, this not run to suit those towards the rear; raced off the pace, steady headway under 3f out, never on terms; possesses the physique to possibly progress again into next season and he should be capable of being competitive in listed races at least judged on what he achieved last time."
"Won | [RACE]: As fiercely a competitive handicap as the numbers suggested, the main action happening more towards the near side in the finish and Pressure's On was always in a good spot just behind the pace, a whole host of closers in behind him shaping well given troubled passages, not least his fellow dead-heater, Quest For Fun, who looked unlucky not get the outright success. | [HORSE]: had to wait for a run but flew home once he got daylight to force the dead-heat. He'd been on a long losing run but was unlucky not to win outright."
"7th of 16, competitive | [RACE]: Morning going stick readings suggested the ground was quicker on the stand side than the rest of the course and that seemed to be borne out by the result to what looked a competitive sprint handicap, the first 3 all from a select group of 4 that stuck to the rail, the rest having come down the centre with the field converging about 2f out. | [HORSE]: came a long way in little time last year, his season curtailed in early September after an impressive Goodwood win and though he was strong in the market for his first outing since, looked very rusty in the early stages, also eding up furthest away from the near rail; mid-division, off the bridle before most, headway over 2f out, plugged on; he's worth another chance."
"3rd of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The first 2 and the fourth were soon prominent on the rail, Bearwith's effort worth marking up in the circumstances, while those caught wide can be forgiven their runs, all of which suggests a relatively cautious view of the winner's improvement. | [HORSE]: moved into the race smoothly and could be marked up as the only one of the first four home who didn't race towards the far rail in the straight. He's been consistent this season and still appears to be on a fair mark."
"9th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: An well-run handicap with the majority of those to race prominently finishing well beaten, the form appealing as just reasonable with several of the fancied runners underperforming. | [HORSE]: after another 11-week absence, wasn't seen to best effect on only his second start of the year; mid-field, ridden no room under 2f out, no chance after."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A basement-grade contest but one at least run at a sound pace, Makalu making his first start at this level a winning one. | [HORSE]: lost all chance at the start on her first outing since leaving John Joseph Murphy following an 18-month absence; very slowly away and tailed off soon after; one to treat with caution."
"5th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fairly ordinary handicap in the main in which the first 3 finished clear, though the profiles of the first 2 suggest they are ones to be positive about, neither long with their current yard and looking likely to win more races near to hand. | [HORSE]: turned out again quickly and fitted with eyeshields and blinkers for first time, ran to just a similar level to last time and is operating below best at present; slowly into stride, held up, met some trouble over 2f out, hung left early in straight, late headway, left poorly placed."
"4th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: What looked a tight handicap on paper was ultimately blown apart by one producing a clear career best on her seasonal return, a position out the back on the far side proving perfect in a race where the leaders went hard. | [HORSE]: a stablemate of the third, came back to form, finishing much closer to Michaela's Boy than he had at Epsom."
"6th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A useful handicap but probably muddling form, the field bunched at the line and a few meeting trouble, the winner doing well to overcome the worst of it and both Summer of Love and Boardman better than they were able to show. | [HORSE]: hasn't really been seen to best effect on any of his starts this year, but this was perhaps the firmest indication yet that he's on the way back; slowly into stride, raced well off the pace, shaken up under 2f out, kept on well, finished with running left."
"12th of 19, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A pair of low-mileage 3-y-os came to the fore but, despite a good gallop, it's probably wise not to take the overall form quite at face value given quite a few met trouble in running, notably the favourite in sixth. | [HORSE]: gelded since last seen and without the headgear this time, wasn't disgraced back down in trip after 15 months off but looked far from straightforward; patiently ridden, ridden out wide 2f out, hung badly left over 1f out, never a threat."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap in which the gallop was fair at best, the runner-up doing well to get as close as he did. | [HORSE]: went like the best horse at the weights; poorly drawn, dropped out, travelled well, had to wait for gap home turn, headway when had to weave way through final 1f, ran on late, nearest at the finish, left poorly placed; he's well worth persevering with at this trip, or maybe even 7f, and appeals as the type who'll benefit from returning to a track with a longer straight."
"7th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A very messy finish to this nursery with several meeting severe interference over 1f out as Dragon Spin veered off a true path, the winner avoiding the worst of it, with the third, fourth and seventh the chief sufferers. | [HORSE]: switching to a first-time visor, was still close up but had already been carried off his line when hampered inside the last."
"4th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A standard handicap for the grade but several in and around the frame have slipped to workable marks now, so there's reason to take note of a couple. | [HORSE]: has now run better than his form figures suggest in each of his last three starts. Hampered by a wide trip in his previous two, he was well drawn this time but taken on for the lead and ended up setting things up for the closers. He should remain of interest, the blinkers having had a beneficial effect of late."
"Won | [RACE]: A basement-grade handicap which turned into a messy affair, the first 2 finishing a long way clear of the remainder, late interference caused by first-past-the-post Manton Road enough for stewards to award Perfect Ruby the victory. | [HORSE]: reacted positively to a change in headgear and was rightly awarded the race in the stewards' room, having received a hefty bump by the wayward Manton Road near the finish. She can't go up much once reassessed."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A cracking end-of-season handicap and the gallop was an honest one from the outset, the leader then pressing on 4f out which resulted in an attritional finish, a pair who'd been up with the pace split by the bang in-form favourite, the smart Bolster value for a bit more than the winning margin and it should prove solid form. | [HORSE]: less exposed than the rest (one of just a pair of 3-y-os), got a much stronger gallop to aim at this time switched to a handicap and shaped well, looking in good order beforehand and settling fine after being keen to post, the yard remaining in very good form; close up, driven under 3f out, edged left over 1f out, not quicken; still far from the finished article and given his physique he should have plenty more to offer at 4 yrs, looking sure to add to his debut success."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful contest run at a sound gallop, all of them having their chance despite a bit of early scrimmaging, the winner still unexposed in handicaps and appealing as one who may do better again. | [HORSE]: a winner at Southwell prior to running below form on her turf debut at Newmarket, relished this return to the artificial surfaces, doubling her tally under a well-judged and considerate ride. Switched sharply left at the top of the home straight, she ran on strongly under only hands-and-heels and was value for a good bit more than the neck margin. She can't go up much for this and will demand plenty of respect on her next start."
"15th of 16, well beaten | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap that was taken apart by one making his debut in this sphere, Isle of Jura set to win by several lengths until heavily eased and clearly one to follow as he climbs the ranks; the frame was completed by a couple who arrived in good form and Outgun, who would probably have finished second granted a clear run, this trio, along with the timefigure, adding weight to the idea this is strong form. | [HORSE]: stopped quickly after receiving a small bump. She'd hinted at better to come in qualifying for a mark, so may be worth another chance."
"Won | [RACE]: There was the usual quota of trouble in running for a double-figure field around this track, plenty not seen to best effect, notably the favourite back in fifth, but with in-form sorts coming to the fore this still appeals as strong form and a race that's sure to throw up its share of winners in the coming weeks; the gallop was strong and most of the principals came from mid-field or further back. | [HORSE]: has been in good form over a mile on a sound surface and he defied a 2lb rise, picking up smartly wide and from off the pace to post a career best. He's closely related to a French Group 3 winner and can surely rate higher yet."
"3rd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair nursery, the winner pretty experienced by now but finding a bit extra to get off the mark, the third catching the eye in behind. | [HORSE]: , comfortably held in three novice outings from 5f to 7f, didn't have things go at all to plan on this nursery debut, completely losing his place when short of room on the inner at halfway. However, he stayed on nicely enough under a considerate ride inside the final furlong to suggest he's got a race of this nature in him. He's bred to get a good deal further."
"5th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modestly-run affair that favoured those that raced up with the pace, Al Qaasim always to the fore and not needing to improve on recent form to resume winning ways. | [HORSE]: off the same mark as when beaten a head at Nottingham five days earlier, was locked away on the inside with nowhere to go rounding the home turn and when finally in the clear it was too late. He may not have won, but would have been closer. He's 1-27."
"2nd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: Unsurprisingly, this turned out to be tactical and, with less than a length separating the first 4, not too much store should be placed on the form, the winner seen to maximum effect from the front. | [HORSE]: turned out again quickly and strong in the betting, probably should have won but, as on his previous start, failed to run straight off the bridle and it cost him; chased leader, keen, hung left from 2f out and seemed hesitant about making his effort between rivals (slightly short of room), stayed on towards finish when it was too late; he's undoubtedly capable of defying this sort of mark but is increasingly looking like the type who needs things to fall just right."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: The pair that had run up to their best last time filled the last 2 places, which made this less competitive than it might have been, and the race itself was a bit unsatisfactory, with 2 racing solo up the rail on either side, the rest up the middle before drifting towards the stand side; that said, the winner scored in clearcut fashion and showed himself better than ever. | [HORSE]: gave it a bold go racing far side on his own, only running out of steam in the last 110yds."
"Won | [RACE]: A fair nursery on balance, the winner progressing with each run to date and clinging on from the rallying runner-up; the gallop only picked up from around halfway. | [HORSE]: improved further to get off the mark on all-weather/handicap debut, the quirks she showed best put down to residual greenness for now; held up, carried head awkwardly/looked ungainly as she made headway out wide 2f out, led over final 1f, just held on as front pair drew clear; had nothing to spare at the line but made a big move to hit the front and is in good hands, so may do better still."
"Won | [RACE]: A surprise result to a competitive handicap, though the form does have a bit of subtance to it, the winner totally unexposed and chased home by a trio that had all placed at a similar level last time. | [HORSE]: after 11 weeks off, left previous efforts behind fitted with a tongue strap for handicap bow, unfancied in the betting but proving a different proposition entirely with more positive tactics employed, easing clear in the manner of one that will have no problem following up; broke well, made running, travelled smoothly, drew clear from 2f out, won easily."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful handicap, the winner confirming the promise of his stable debut, chased home by in-form sorts. | [HORSE]: a confirmed front-runner, ran a blinder as not only did he not enjoy an easy lead, he battled back most gamely after the winner headed him, only giving best late on. There will be another day."
"17th of 19, well beaten | [RACE]: As ever a hotly-contested handicap and it's surely strong form with obvious reasons for being positive about at least the first 7 next time; the pace was brisk and the first 3 all came from off the pace down the outside. | [HORSE]: is still unexposed and on a good mark judged on his strong 2023 form but just looked rusty after 8 months off and never figured; dropped out, intimidated after 2f, ridden out wide home turn, no response; he's surely worth another chance."
"5th of 6, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap run at a modest pace, the odds-on favourite not delivering under pressure, but the winner is going the right way herself and did it with something to spare. | [HORSE]: ran respectably after 6 months off and this should tee her up for another winter on the all-weather (won 3 times around the turn of last year and is edging back down to last winning mark); held up, headway when short of room 1f out, not quicken, not knocked about."
"Won | [RACE]: ARRANGE (IRE) was subsequently demoted | [HORSE]: , back up in trip, did well to come from the position she did in a falsely run race, especially as she ran out of room at a crucial stage. She's better than the bare facts suggest and she's one to keep onside after reassessment."
"26th of 28, well beaten | [RACE]: A strong running of the Wokingham, containing plenty of interesting 4-y-os, none more so than the unexposed favourite who would have completed the hat-trick in another stride, but it went to another better-than-ever last-time-out winner instead who was ridden in stark contrast, Get It registering a very rare all-the-way success in a major handicap on the straight course here, the time very much underpinning the value of the form; they split into 2 groups, the 7 highest drawn coming towards the stand rail , all bar Korker staying there, with the remainder in the centre, it clear from under 2f out that the smaller group were disadvantaged, Holkham Bay shaping very well in the circumstances, whilst the majority of those drawn 1-9, the notable exception being Ten Pounds, ended up caught on the far wing of the peloton with nothing to tow them into the race and a few from that camp also had excuses. | [HORSE]: ran a shocker making his debut in Britain after 6 weeks off; raced centre, mid-division, struggling under 2f out, eased off."
"8th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: An in-form pair were split by a well-weighted veteran in a competitive event; it got a bit messy 1f out when Wen Moon hung to the stand rail, Monsieur Kodi and Twelfth Knight chiefly affected. | [HORSE]: won first time out last campaign and, back down in trip, shaped much better than the distance beaten suggests, looking to have returned in top form; mid-field, headway under pressure 2f out, every chance when short of room 1f out, not recover, eased off."
"4th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: A pair pulled clear in this fair handicap, the winner finding plenty to collar one who'd gone with plenty of zest in front, while the fourth caught the eye doing good late work from further back. | [HORSE]: after 3 months off, very much caught the eye, travelling with plenty of verve but essentially asked for his effort too late; dwelt, in rear, travelled well, headway approaching final 1f, stayed on, nearest at the finish; he's below his last winning mark on all-weather and is one to note next time."
"2nd of 6, competitive | [RACE]: Wisper was strong in the betting and looked sure to win when cruising up 2f out, just not finding anything like as much as one that has been transformed by the recent addition of cheekpieces, the first 3 pulling well clear of the rest. | [HORSE]: well backed, certainly travelled as if still in top form, just not delivering under pressure this time; dwelt, mid-field, travelled strongly, headway 2f out, ridden over 1f out, edged left, found less than looked likely."
"3rd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: Still a big field for this track, despite the withdrawal of those drawn in 15 and 16 and it was run at a sound gallop, Evocative Spark looking the likely winner for a long way but run down by a late closer than got a clearer run than some, Truely Aclaimed unlucky while Grifter was value for finishing closer, the form appealing as likely to work out quite well. | [HORSE]: took her form up a notch after 12 weeks off and was unlucky not to win given how things developed; mid-division, travelled well, had to wait for gap early in straight, forced wide over 1f out, finished strongly but conceded first run; will benefit from a return to 1m and is one to look out for."
"Won | [RACE]: An unsustainable gallop for the grade provided the platform for a pair of in-form ones to come well clear. | [HORSE]: enhanced a good strike-rate with a career-best effort to defy a penalty up in trip, suited by the strong pace and always holding off the second as they came well clear. He might be hit quite hard for this by the handicapper, but he's thriving and unexposed over this distance."
"5th of 10, competitive | [RACE]: A messy handicap, the gallop steady but the finish still dominated by those who came from mid-field or further back courtesy of the headwind; that said, it should throw up its share of winners, a few interesting runners dotted through the field behind the comfortable winner, notably the second and the fourth. | [HORSE]: looked to have been handed a fairly stiff opening mark, but was better than the bare result on first outing since leaving Roger Varian after 11 months off, positive tactics not the order of the day given the headwind; led, not settle fully, pushed along under 2f out, headed over 1f out, hampered soon after, not recover; he's one to consider in top-end handicaps, or back in listed races."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A farce of a race, the decision to use a flip start due to the stalls handlers being stuck in traffic resulting in over half the field losing all chance at the start, most of the embarrassment spared by the fact that 90% of the race was unseeable due to heavy mist, all other races on the card eventually abandoned. | [HORSE]: was another to break well and be involved in the finish as a result; prominent, kept on, pulled clear of remainder, well positioned."
"7th of 16, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A really competitive handicap on paper, but a lot less so on the track, the fairly-lightly-raced winner setting up an excellent day for his stable, more handily ridden than the well-backed second and in-form third in a race in which the gallop wasn't flat out for a big-field handicap, though the form still looks very solid. | [HORSE]: back on turf, had little go right in the race, shaping better than the bare result, and remains one to be interested in; chased leaders, not clear run over 2f out, no room again 1f out, finished with running left."
"Won | [RACE]: A modest handicap overall, but the efforts of the thriving pair who fought out the finish can both be viewed in a positive light. | [HORSE]: is thriving at present and recorded a third win of the year in good style, helped by the drop back down in grade but doing well all the same, coming from a long way back even allowing for the sound gallop; dwelt, held up, still plenty to do 2f out, angled towards outer and effort soon after, swept through to lead final 50 yds; he'll continue to give a good account."
"7th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: The pace didn't really pick up until after halfway and it paid to be prominent. | [HORSE]: was better than the result again and remains one to be interested in, his mark having slid still further; mid-field, not settle fully, still going well when shuffled back approaching final 1f, no chance after and not knocked about."
"3rd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: Probably nothing really well treated in this handicap and 2 that raced near the stand rail late on fought it out, the winner squeezing up the inside to lead late, though the third might've beaten them both but for botching the start. | [HORSE]: was back on turf and in a first-time hood. He left the stalls very slowly, which he's done before, then compounded the problem by looking reluctant initially. It was a surprise to see him finish as close as he did and he has descended to a decent mark on his form from a couple of seasons ago."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A solid 3-y-o handicap for all it wasn't exactly chockful of potential, the one improving the quickest sweeping down the outer to win decisively, a couple in behind shaping with promise having met some trouble. | [HORSE]: ran poorly back up in trip, stopping as if something was amiss; led until 2f out, folded tamely 1f out."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap in which a prominent position proved a slight advantage, Dark Side Thunder confirming recent promise at this track but perhaps a shade fortunate to hold off the runner-up given how much ground that one made up. | [HORSE]: who travelled strongly, was stopped in his run in the straight and will be considered by many an unlucky loser. However, he had every chance of going by the winner inside the final half-furlong and was unable to do so, so it's not perhaps as black and white as it initially appeared."
"Won | [RACE]: A sprint handicap run at a sound gallop, with Ballet Steps having matters in control over 1f out. | [HORSE]: quickly put this to bed and slammed her rivals. She disappointed after a winning start at two, but has obviously wintered well and made a mockery of this opening handicap mark. On this evidence a solid pace is key and she'll get 6f, although she does now have to show she's not best mad fresh."
"Won | [RACE]: A quicker time than the opening division and this appeals as a much more robust piece of form, a class-dropper and the reliable favourite pulling clear of some fellow interesting and well-weighted types, the timefigure underpinning a positive view. | [HORSE]: back on softer ground, capitalised on a falling mark (below last winning one) with more in hand than the result implies; prominent, led under pressure 2f out, in command entering final 1f, closed down final 50 yds; this will more than likely force him back into a higher grade."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: Not many progressive types in this ordinary handicap, the winner an obvious exception as he followed up a recent success in gritty fashion, while the fifth is worth marking up after meeting trouble several times. | [HORSE]: beaten 12 times since making a winning debut here, was tried in a visor. She looked as though the race was hers when hitting the front, but once there she hung away to her left and was run out of it. She is already due another 3lb drop."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap that wasn't as competitive as seemed likely, Run With It not on a going day and Spirit of Leros blowing the start, whilst the favourite in second didn't convince 100% with his attitude either, Carron probably only requiring a small step forward; the gallop was on the steady side and it proved an advantage to be handy. | [HORSE]: seemed suited by the return to more positive tactics after 12 weeks off, settling better than last time despite the longer trip, and got back on the up, but there were some negatives to this display as well; led after 2f, pushed along 2f out, looked in control briefly 1f out, flashed tail final 1f, worn down final 50 yds; clearly has the ability to defy a mark in the mid 80s, especially as further progress can't be ruled out after just a handful of runs, but he could be the type who will benefit from headgear and/or a gelding operation."
"6th of 18, competitive | [RACE]: There hasn't been much in between pace-wise in the longer-distance handicaps on the round course this week and this fell firmly into the category of the leaders overdoing things, as Live Your Dream committed fully 3f out having already been responsible for ensuring a contested gallop alongside the same owner's Global Heat, the winner and runner-up coming from the second and third waves respectively, widest of all - not for the first time at the meeting - in the case of Okita Soushi as things got very tight for a few late on in a slow-motion finish. | [HORSE]: bounced back to form, indicating his poor run at Epsom wasn't down to the quick conditions."
"7th of 16, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A big field for this useful handicap that was run at a strong gallop, Dakota Gold giving those drawn low a tow into the race, but they seemed to do a bit too much, the first and third sweeping through from off the pace much wider, plenty to like about the effort of It Just Takes Time to split them. | [HORSE]: has tended to need a run or 2 to come to the boil over the last couple of seasons and probably needed this after 6 months off; held up, pushed along halfway, edged left 2f out, weakened inside final 1f; he's best ridden more positively and will be of greater interest when the headgear and tongue strap go back on (likely to be down to last winning mark next time)."
"8th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair apprentice handicap in which those towards the head of the market came to the fore, though the favourite in second had a better run through than most of them, the winner deserving plenty of credit in edging him out given his wide trip. | [HORSE]: got stuck in behind a wall of horses and wasn't able to deliver a challenge when her rider would have wanted to, but it's also reasonable to say she didn't pick up when able to find a clear path."
"2nd of 6 | [RACE]: Brave Emperor was subsequently demoted | [HORSE]: upped in trip, after 11 weeks off, was giving away plenty of weight all round and improved again, only denied a 4-timer by the stewards; led, ridden over 2f out, hung right over 1f out, joined final 100 yds and bumped Mohatu soon after, all out to hold on, subsequently demoted to second; this isn't the first time he's edged that way under pressure, but there seemed little wrong with his attitude at the death and he's a well-made type who is unexposed at this trip, so he should continue to give a good account."
"6th of 14, fairly beaten | [RACE]: An ordinary event for 3-y-os in which the favourite never went a yard, the front 2 - who came into the race on the back of good recent efforts - pulling nicely clear. | [HORSE]: back on turf (for first time since debut), continues to show little, even at a farly low level, though wasn't given at all a hard time here, and may yet do better back over longer trips; slowly into stride, mid-division, pushed along 3f out, plugged on final 1f, hands-and-heels ride."
"5th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: Another race in which the pace held up, though with not too many likeable sorts on display, this probably won't turn out to be strong form, the winner at least one of few who gives her running more often than not. | [HORSE]: has been given a chance by the handicapper and returned to form for all he unsurprisingly didn't see his race out fully, being lugged into when still leading perhaps offering some mitigation on this occasion; led, raced freely, ridden when bumped approaching final 1f, headed final 100 yds, no extra."
"6th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that produced a tight finish, though it did prove something of a 'draw' race, those in double-figure stalls struggling to make much of an impact, the first 5 home all from the low numbers and well positioned towards the far side, the effort of Boyne Lady in sixth well worth marking up given her draw/where she raced. | [HORSE]: shaped well from a poor draw and may well have been involved in the finish if she'd had the same track position as the majority of those ahead of her; mid-field towards near side, ridden under 2f out, kept on final 1f, nearest at the finish; she's one to keep an eye on."
"5th of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: A memorable evening for the winning trainer, saddling the first 3 home and this also the final leg of a treble on the card, the third ensuring it was a test despite the small field, the winner denying an in-form sort. | [HORSE]: back under a fully-fledged rider and down in grade, has beaten just 2 rivals in 4 starts this year and continues to fall in the weights without showing any sign of taking advantage after 6 weeks off; slowly into stride, held up, driven over 3f out, brief headway 2f out, dropped away final 1f, not persevered with."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: There was little to separate the top 4 in the betting, but the eventual second-favourite made just about all to supplement his recent Yarmouth success; the field went far side, the second deserving extra credit having stayed more towards the centre for the majority of the contest. | [HORSE]: didn't have the cards fall his way, making a challenge from a position which started the closest to the stands' side, so deserves plenty of credit for keeping on into a never-nearer second. He's on a winning mark, so could pick up something soon over 5f or 6f."
"4th of 5, well beaten | [RACE]: A thin handicap, the winner encouragingly backing up his effort at Newbury the previous month after a long lay-off. | [HORSE]: was attempting to make ground, albeit through a gap that wasn't there, when clipping heels and almost coming down a little under 2f out."
"4th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap that was switched from the cancelled Friday fixture and on a par with the Portland over 1f shorter in terms of quality, if perhaps not depth given the smaller field and the form of the first 2 is bordering on smart, Asjad having a good strike rate this year for all the binary appearance of his form figures. | [HORSE]: wasted no time getting back to form, proving himself on good to soft going and likely to have run right up to form granted a level playing field; held up, pushed along 3f out, short of room under 2f out, had to weave way through, ran on."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A strongly-run 3-y-o handicap that should prove solid enough, the winner taking a step forward to nail the long-time leader, who did well in the circumstances. | [HORSE]: quicky bounced back from Haydock, back to looking straightforward here and running best race; led, shaken up entering straight, edged right final 1f, kept on well, headed dying strides; did well to sustain his effort given how hard he went off and probably has more races in him this summer."
"3rd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: With less than 2 lengths covering the first 7 home, this probably isn't form to go overboard on, though the first 3 all have plenty to recommend them going forward, the winner having the best trip of that trio, which proved crucial in the end. | [HORSE]: is a hostage to fortune given how she's ridden but she wins her share and this was a cracking effort given where she came from, especially in relation to the other principals. She can win again sooner rather than later."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modest handicap run at a steady pace and the winner was less exposed than most of these and quickened up the best in the straight. | [HORSE]: keen enough early, was produced to win his race entering the last furlong, but then dived to the inside rail and had no answer to the filly's turn of foot. He is now 0-12, but has finished runner-up in his last five outings and keeps edging up the weights for not winning."
"12th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly-run handicap that ought to prove reasonable form for the level, Solanna back in good nick but nailed late on by one of several fancied 3-y-os, the others all there or thereabouts, too. | [HORSE]: on first outing since leaving Daragh Bourke (sold 9,750 gns), was given a considerate return from 10 weeks off fitted with a first-time hood; slowly into stride, took strong hold, never involved but not given at all a hard time."
"7th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: The second and third might be exposed but both arrived in good nick on fair marks and, with the unexposed winner seeing them off comfortably, this has the look of solid form for the grade, underpinned by a good gallop and a time more than 3 seconds quicker than the second division. | [HORSE]: failed to make an impact, her rider reporting she hung left-handed."
"3rd of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A well-run handicap but probably just ordinary form, improvers thin on the ground, the runner-up sure to have collected had he got into the clear sooner. | [HORSE]: shaped encouragingly on his handicap debut and first start for Richard Fahey after five months off. He was another to come from further back in the field, also receiving a slight bump from the weakening Yermanthere."
"6th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: A number of interesting ones in a race that looked stronger than a typical 0-70, though an ordinary gallop led to plenty of trouble for those behind when 2 of the leaders weakened turning for home, the first 2 avoiding it by going wide, with the winner getting first run on the runner-up. | [HORSE]: was too keen early and didn't get home over this longer trip."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Strong form for the grade, a couple who arrived on a roll filling the first 2 places, whilst further back Match Play caught the eye. | [HORSE]: made up a considerable amount of ground in the final furlong and is handicapped to win. While this was an eyecatching effort, it does come with the slight caveat that this was the second run in succession he's missed the kick and he didn't go with much enthusiasm early. He's done his winning when making the running but those tactics won't be easy to reproduce if the stalls continue to be an issue."
"2nd of 16, involved in finish | [RACE]: The third running of a handicap which must be considered a terrific addition to the card with it again attracting a good-quality field of staying types despite it coming just over an hour after the Ascot Stakes; as in that race there was a lack of a true gallop which rendered it something of a tactical affair, though the form still looks strong with 2 of the least-exposed runners following home a thriving rival, the third in particular doing well from his position. | [HORSE]: who had defeated Ascot Stakes winner Coltrane when getting up late to win the Chester Cup last month, gave this a good go off a 5lb higher mark, down in trip, just lacking the gears of the winner on ground that was probably as quick as he wants it."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful fillies' handicap, but tactics played their part in the result, the first 2 always well positioned up with the pace, the third doing well to get as close as she did. | [HORSE]: after five months off, did not have this set up for her hold-up style and didn't get a clear run through. She needs things to drop right but can do better."
"6th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap, but one that should work out, a thriving older horse edging out a couple of 3-y-os who may have more to give. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden for handicap debut, wasn't seen to best effect; mid-field, pushed along home turn, hampered over 1f out, not recover; he should prove suited by this far and may yet do better."
"Won | [RACE]: This isn't the handicap it once was, as shown by the fact that it was worth less to the winner than in 1992. but there's no doubt it was won by one ahead of its mark, Mostly Gloudy extending his winning sequence to 5 and becoming the fourth 3-y-o winner in the last 6 renewals. | [HORSE]: keeps on getting better (very much on toes beforehand), making it 5 on the spin with another improved performance, this mark 26 lb higher than the one he defied at the beginning of his sequence; in touch, pushed along 4f out, produced to lead over 1f out, forged clear; who's to say he's shown all he can just yet and, though he'll have to go up further in grade next time, his stable has already proved themselves shrewd readers of the programme book."
"5th of 7, competitive | [RACE]: A fair handicap that looks reliable form, Bicep setting a sound pace and just holding off a couple who came from right out the back. | [HORSE]: back under a fully-fledged rider, wasn't seen to best effect and looks on the way back; mid-field, pushed along early in straight, short of room under 2f out, kept on, finished with running left."
"8th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A modest handicap notable for the contrasting luck enjoyed by the top 2 in the betting, the winner getting a good run up the stand rail while the favourite in third suffered a very troubled passage and looked unlucky not to win. | [HORSE]: could never get involved from a pitch on the far flank; slowly into stride, raced wide/off the pace, never landed a blow."
"3rd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: Possibly not the most solid form, the first 2 better placed than the next 2 home in a steadily-run race, one or two others also not seen to best effect. | [HORSE]: returned to form back up in trip off a career-low mark, shaping well in faring best of those held up despite meeting trouble; held up, still plenty to do 3f out, headway when not clear run and barged way out of a pocket over 1f out, finished well."
"Won | [RACE]: A 3-y-o contest that ought to prove good form the level, the improved winner coming through late to cut down a quartet of interesting sorts, a couple of whom similarly retain the potential for better still; the pace was modest early but picked up around 4f out. | [HORSE]: a non-stayer over 1m2f at Pontefract last time, was back at arguably his optimum distance for the first time this year and was able to cash in off a reduced mark, eased in grade. Confidence will be buoyed after this first success and, given he's regularly run to RPRs in the low 70s, there's every reason to believe he can build on this back in Class 5 company."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair 3-y-o handicap that went to one who returned to form from out of the blue, but he was at least chased home by a couple with good recent form to their name. | [HORSE]: , biding to make it 2-2 over C&D, also moved strongly and looked the one to be on a furlong out. He spoilt his cause by hanging over the far side under maximum pressure, though, and was just denied."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap and several of these will remain competitive in similar events, though the bare form on the day is a bit suspect with the first 3 having every chance to the fore while a trio got no run in behind and shaped as if they'd have been bang involved with clear passages. | [HORSE]: one of the least exposed, shaped well back on all-weather, unlucky not to finish closer and well worth keeping an eye on this winter; poorly drawn, dwelt, in rear, ridden over 2f out, good headway over 1f out, keeping on when no room, ran on late; will remain of plenty of interest."
"2nd of 19, involved in finish | [RACE]: A cracking field on paper, and a good one on looks too, chock full of lightly-raced, improving horses with good pedigrees, and it's sure to produce plenty of winners for the remainder of the summer, even if the result might not be the most solid, less than 2 and a half lengths covering the first 7 home, with the next wave right on their heels too, after the pace had been a fair bit steadier than the following small-field Ribblesdale, a position close to the front an advantage, the fourth and fifth producing among the fastest final 3f times from further back, while most of the jockeys drawn high chose to take back meaning, rather rarely for this C&D, that low draws dominated, 6 of the first 7 home emerging from a single-figure berth. | [HORSE]: appreciated the longer trip and turned in his best effort on this handicap debut after having to be switched for a run early in the straight. He shapes as though he'll stay a bit further and a race like the Melrose at York's August meeting could be an interesting target."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: The front pair pulled an unfeasibly long way clear in this 3-y-o handicap, the winner reeling in one that got first run but whose rider lacked a little urgency in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: not seen to best effect last time, was very well backed and left the impression he should have won, looking in control once kicking for home, his claimer looking over both shoulders in the final 1f while not being quite as vigorous as earlier, hard ridden again when the winner came upsides but the damage done; handy, travelled smoothly, led over 2f out, ridden over 2f out, headed final 50 yds; the handicapper will have his say given how far clear of the third he was but he's clearly capable of winning something similar."
"5th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: The sole 3-y-o was the only one near the ceiling rating for what has to go down as a thin handicap for the grade, that he was seen off by Cisco Disco having been produced with his challenge 1f out only adding to the disappointing feel. | [HORSE]: has earned himself a squiggle for his increasing inconsistency; missed the break, raced off the pace, brief headway over 2f out, effort proved short-lived."
"11th of 29, competitive | [RACE]: A typically ultra-competitive renewal and, just what's expected from handicaps at major meetings, it's hard to think this is anything but strong form, 4-y-os predominantly coming to the fore, the likeable winner one of those as was the favourite in fifth who remains with the most long-term potential; rarely for such a big field, they decided to race in one group, the principals coming mainly from off the pace with the action developing centre-to-far side, some of those drawn high can be excused or marked up as a result, Tactical the most notable. | [HORSE]: up 5lb for winning the Victoria Cup, and with his smart rider claiming 2lb less this time, would have finished closer but for being hampered 2f out."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: An open and competitive handicap, run at a good pace, the field well strung out turning for home, though the usual traffic problems on this track occured, the first 2 coming fast and late from off the pace on the outside, the winner himself having to squeeze through to get a run, the fourth and seventh among those better than the result, the form in general still worth viewing positively. | [HORSE]: put up a solid showing having his first go in handicaps, just having nothing left towards the end having again raced keenly (despite drop in trip). There's a bigger effort in him if he settles."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive 0-80 which revolved around the penalised Dubai Beach, though she perhaps found a busy spell catching up with her and proved vulnerable to a progressive 3-y-o. | [HORSE]: whose third behind Kon Tiki (now rated 100) and Life Is Beautiful (now rated 98) here in April reads well, looked interesting back on the AW. She was out the back with the winner turning in and ran on almost as well, meeting traffic problems a furlong out which halted her momentum. She's one to keep in mind for a similar race."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: They went off at a good clip in what was a fair handicap and the first 2 benefited from being held onto. | [HORSE]: previously trained in Ireland, was well backed on her debut for her new stable. She wasn't best away but was then rushed up to lead and probably did too much too soon. She lost a shoe and had a small wound on the same leg."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: This looked quite competitive for the grade and plenty had a chance in the straight, though it became a messy race, the runner-up, the most interesting of these for the future. | [HORSE]: stepped up on his reappearance run, under a claiming rider for the first time, shaping as if he's on a good mark, likely to have gone even closer if not caught so far back; held up, not settle fully, still plenty to do 2f out, effort straight, had to weave way through, took second late on, finished with running left; still not fully exposed and one to be interested in."
"4th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A couple weren't seen to best effect that way the race unfolded, including the eventual fourth, but it still has the look of reasonable form for the level, the first 3 home and the aforementioned One Of Our Own all arriving on the back of a recent win/good performance; the pace was sound. | [HORSE]: couldn't confirm recent Redcar form with the winner having not been seen to best effect on this occasion, though showed enough to suggest she remains in good order; mid-division, not clear run early in straight, forced to switch 2f out, kept on, never nearer."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A messy contest in which the well-backed favourite split a pair of 3-y-os but it takes a bit of explaining, those drawn high predominantly coming to the fore, the lightly-raced Ski Angel the notable exception, the runner-up likely to have gone close if getting a clear run; meanwhile on the opposite flank, Nodasgoodasawink caused plenty of interference after going right upon leaving the stalls, carrying the majority drawn lower than her away from the action, a few from that side worth excusing as a result. | [HORSE]: posted another solid effort, confirming Ayr form with Bonito Cavalo. She's a likeable filly who should continue to do well in this grade."
"Won | [RACE]: A basement-level handicap won readily by the sole progressive horse in the line-up; the pace was sound. | [HORSE]: in search of the hat-trick under a double penalty, travelled nicely in midfield and picked up strongly to bring up the treble in good style. He is now 3-3 over 7f+, and for this trainer/rider combination, and looks to have a bit more to give."
"4th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful 3-y-o handicap in which the gallop was reasonable, but it still proved hard to get involved from too far back, the first 3 home always handy, something that puts a better spin in the effort of the never-nearer favourite in fourth. | [HORSE]: having his first run on a sound surface on turf, was the eyecatcher in a race that favoured those who raced up with the pace. He deserves plenty of credit for finishing as close as he did and he can make amends."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: An eventful finish to a handicap in which it paid to be handy, a last-time-out winner that was well positioned just holding off a progressive sort that didn't get the clearest of passages. | [HORSE]: progressed again on the back of a 6-week break and was probably unlucky not to win, not so well placed as the winner but only just failing having had to weave his way through; mid-division, took keen hold, going well when not clear run over 2f out, forced to switch approaching final 1f, upsides well inside final 1f, edged out post; one to be interested in."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: An exposed field, and the elongated margins between them suggest hardly any ran their race, but the front 2 were among those to line up in good nick; She's Out of Reach was withdrawn at the start. | [HORSE]: can come good again soon in his current form but has now hamstrung himself with a slow start twice in a row; dwelt, held up, smooth headway from 3f out, closed down leader 1f out, held when entering final 50 yds, pulled clear of remainder."
"9th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A fair 3-y-o handicap run at a solid tempo, the front pair both showing improved form as they pulled nicely clear of the third, the favourite much further back worth giving a pass to on the back of a tough trip. | [HORSE]: was 3lb well in under her penalty, but she had to have plenty of use made of her to get a prominent position from stall 11, and with competition for the lead she was caught three wide on the bend. Inevitably she dropped out in the straight, and this is easily forgiven."
"6th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: Any number of perennial low-grade handicappers, but the fact the sole unexposed one burst through late to take command could be considered a small crumb of positivity to the form. | [HORSE]: again shaped better than the bare result, leaving the strong impression he should have finished much closer; patiently ridden, shaken up briefly halfway, headway when no room from 2f out, finished with running left."
"6th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap in which the places were filled by a trio who have come down the weights, a few further back better than the bare result, notably Out of Sight who would have gone very close granted luck in running. | [HORSE]: found run of seconds coming to an end, but performed respectably; mid-division, ridden under 3f out, headway under pressure 2f out, weakening when hampered final 100 yds."
"3rd of 4, involved in finish | [RACE]: A weak contest than unfolded into a dash up the straight, the first 2 in those positions throughout, the returning third shaping with some promise from furthest back. | [HORSE]: making his stable debut in a first-time tongue-tie, couldn't cope with the front pair but this was a creditable return from 627 days off, having undergone wind surgery since last seen. He was returning off a 7lb lower mark and this gives him something to build on."
"Won | [RACE]: A race confined to horses that had won no more than one race, but that's not to say it was a weak contest on that front, all of them winners this season and most having had no more than a handful of starts to date; the pace was steady and the first 3 deserve credit for the way they asserted themselves on the more prominently-ridden other trio in the latter stages. | [HORSE]: was taking a step up in class for this handicap debut and in a slowly run race she did particularly well to come from nearly last into the straight to beat the well-backed second."
"6th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A slightly quicker time than the first division but this was steadily run too, helping to explain the first of 2 triple-figure-priced winners on the card as Epsom Faithfull's speed for shorter, allied to a clear run up the inside, proved key. | [HORSE]: debuting for a new trainer, shaped a bit better than his finishing position suggests as the race wasn't run to suit and he faced some traffic issues in the straight."
"Won | [RACE]: Quite a weak field for a good-class nursery, the winner impressive on the face it but perhaps seen to advantage, a poor timefigure suggesting a cautious rating is best. | [HORSE]: looked the pick of the weights judged on his Doncaster improvement but built significantly even on that to make a winning nursery debut, seen to good effect getting plenty of cover but clearly creating a good impression; held up, got gap up stand rail and quickened to lead entering final 1f, forged clear; the chances are the handicapper won't look too kindly on such a wide-margin success."
"6th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that looks solid form, the front 3 having all been in good heart this winter. | [HORSE]: shaped as though a fair bit better than his finishing position suggests, persistently denied room in the straight. He's slipped to a handy mark and is one to keep an eye on."
"2nd of 19, involved in finish | [RACE]: A typically-competitive renewal of this fillies' sprint handicap, the draw not having as much of an effect as it often can in sprints here, the field spread across the track with the speedy Eclairage towing those drawn high into it, while the admirable Luna A Inbhir Nis gave a good lead to those drawn lower, the race essentially setting up for those ridden with a touch of patience, a Ryan Moore masterclass putting the winner's head in front on the line, while those 2 aforementioned prominent racers emerged with plenty of credit, the form looking solid all round. | [HORSE]: carrying 1lb overweight, came from the same side of the draw as the winner, but moved more towards the far side late on and was just caught. She's in tremendous heart and is eligible for weaker events than this."
"7th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A blend of in-form and potentially well-treated horses made for quite an interesting race on paper, one of those who'd edged down the weights running out an authoritative winner back at a track where he has a fine record. | [HORSE]: in first-time blinkers, took a step back in the right direction, shaping much better than beating one home might suggest; pressed leader, took strong hold, went on under 4f out, headed under 2f out, not see race out; he won't be one to dismiss out of hand back at 1¼m or even 1m next time."
"Won | [RACE]: A strong gallop on bad ground took most of these out of their comfort zone and there were only a couple who ever looked like winning, Hodler gaining the upper hand 1f out; with the ground so chewed up the inside looked disadvantaged, the winner having circled the field. | [HORSE]: all the fitter for his first 2 runs of the campaign, made the most of the appreciable drop back down in grade, as well as a wide route that was an advantage by this stage of the card; held up, hampered first 1f, good headway out wide from 3f out, chased leader under 2f out, led entering final 1f, kept up to work; he's now 2 from 2 on heavy going."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A weak apprentice handicap, and Poles Apart was the only one to make any inroads from the rear, the in-form Split Elevens produced to lead at just the right time. | [HORSE]: ran well in first-time blinkers and should have better still to come over further; dwelt, in rear, headway out wide final 1f, stayed on, nearest at the finish; will prove suited by a return to 1m+."
"4th of 10, competitive | [RACE]: A steadier gallop than for the first division and probably not reliable form, with the winner having to overcome a troubled passage, whilst the fourth wasn't seen to best effect at all. | [HORSE]: shaped much better than the bare result and is well worth another chance off this revised mark; held up, still plenty to do 2f out, finished with a flourish from an impossible position."
"Won | [RACE]: The favourite ran as if amiss, but he would have struggled to live with Falmouth Bay even on his A game, that one progressing well now and completing the hat-trick with plenty in hand. | [HORSE]: made light of the rise in grade, completing the hat-trick with his easiest win to date and value a bit extra on top of the bare margin to boot; dictated, shaken up 3f out, hung left 2f out, in command soon after, kept on, looked set to win by 3/4 lengths before his rider took things relatively easy in the final 100 yds; will continue to give a good account."
"8th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful performance from the thriving winner who saw the trip out better than the strong-travelling second, not many others landing a telling blow. | [HORSE]: came here in good order but virtually refused to race after just 6 days off, never on terms."
"10th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: A messy handicap and form not to take at face value, a photo-finish required to separate the first 4, plenty of trouble in the last 100 yds or so with Koy Koy and Darkness worst affected, but Carrytheone didn't enjoy anything like a clear run himself and was the winner on merit; most of the field raced towards the stand side this time, the 3 that were more down the centre best given a pass. | [HORSE]: back to 7f, attracted some support but was another to race in that small group of three. He ran okay."
"5th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: An above-average handicap but one full of familiar faces, one of whom outclassed them in a race in which few got involved, neither of which encourages a positive view of the form. | [HORSE]: was given a considerate return from a 3-month break making her debut for this yard (formerly with J. S. Bolger), finding herself a long way back but passing a good few; slowly into stride, raced well off the pace, still plenty to do 3f out, had to pick way through, stayed on gradually late on, not unduly punished."
"20th of 30, well beaten | [RACE]: The draw/track position will always have an impact in this race, though not always to such an extent as this, the field typically splitting into 2 groups, those drawn 1-10 going far side and at a clear disadvantage, the larger stand-side group providing the first 6 home, with stalls 27-31 accounting for the first 5; the majority of those who did come to the fore looked more top-end handicapper than potential pattern race performer, with a few of those towards the head of the betting not seen to best effect, but it still looks sure to throw up its fair share of winners, with the second, sixth and eighth in particular ones to be siding with next time. | [HORSE]: had made a solid start to the season, chasing home a subsequent listed winner on each of his previous 2 outings, and is probably best excused this run; raced far side, in touch, effort 2f out, faded final 1f."
"3rd of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: A handicap controlled by the all-the-way winner, though it's not as if he dawdled in front and he’s still worth full credit for a decidedly useful effort. | [HORSE]: the sole 3-y-o in the field, looked open to further improvement stepping up in trip on handicap debut but was easy to back and seemed to be held back by inexperience off the bridle; dwelt, soon chased leader, shaken up 4f out, edged left under 2f out, dropped to fourth approaching final 1f, plugged on, not knocked about; remains capable of better."
"6th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: There was a fair bit of typical Goodwood messiness to this modestly-run handicap and the blanket finish means the form can't be rated highly, though the first 2 filled those positions in spite of the way things developed and will be of interest again. | [HORSE]: after 6 months off, is best not judged on this handicap debut, things going wrong early; hampered start, held up, raced freely, ridden under 3f out, struggling under 2f out, late headway; he'll stay 1m and is well worth another chance."
"2nd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: Several strands of interest to suggest this ought to be stronger than the workaday class 6 at this time of year, and it's worth taking a reasonably positive view of the pair who came clear, though the third would have finished closer to them with a clear run. | [HORSE]: is improving all the time now and stepped forward again from his handicap bow, probably only lingering greenness catching him out after he'd gone past the winner initially, acknowledging that one seemed to have a shade up his sleeve at the line; waited with, progress under 2f out, headway to lead entering final 1f, edged out final 100 yds; he'll be winning before long."
"Won | [RACE]: A fair handicap in behind but it was won comfortably in the end by a class-dropper that bounced back following a recent breathing operation, value for a bit extra given the ground he made up. | [HORSE]: proved far too good down in grade after 10 weeks off, a recent breathing operation clearly helping him, and he's got plenty of handicapping scope now he's back on track; held up, travelled well, good headway 2f out, short of room over 1f out, switched final 1f, stayed on to lead last ½f, won readily; will remain of plenty of interest."
"13th of 19, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A useful big-field sprint that looks sure to provide plenty of clues for similar races in the next few weeks; the field split into 2 groups, those drawn 12 and below seen to better effect than those high, the first and third up there throughout and split by a strong finisher with several from the other side sure to be at least as interesting next time, Physique a big eye-catcher on his debut for a new stable while Glenfinnan and Trilby both shaping much better than their mid-field placings might suggest. | [HORSE]: tends to need a run or 2 to put him spot on and probably needed this after 5 months off, going without the headgear he wore towards the end of last season; slowly into stride, patiently ridden, pushed along over 2f out, made no impression."
"5th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: A valuable event for the grade and, with 4 last-time-out winners in attendance, it looks strong form, one of the pair of 3-y-os getting the job done with the remainder in the places also arriving in top form, the frame completed by the well-backed favourite. | [HORSE]: upped in trip/grade, shaped similarly to last time despite the fitting of more severe headgear (blinkers replacing cheekpieces), his temperament under suspicion; bumped start, mid-division, went in snatches, stumbled under 3f out, headway when hung left under 2f out, nearest at the finish."
"4th of 10, competitive | [RACE]: Not for the first time of late a pitch towards the near-sde rail proved an advantage in this sprint handicap, the first 4 all well positioned with that in mind and the fourth catching the eye from well back. | [HORSE]: who won this last year, stepped up on recent run and shaped well to boot, once again not given a hard race and he should be much closer to his best next time; soon switched to near side, in rear, ridden over 1f out, late headway; one to keep an eye on with his mark likely to ease a little more."
"4th of 26, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The straight course has seemed very fair all week so far, the groundstaff deserving plenty of plaudits for the state of the surface given the uncertain forecast and any advantage in the bigger fields has tended to be pace related, that certainly appearing the case here, the Wathnan-owned Make Me King leading the group of those drawn 17 or higher at a tempo that brought out the very best in one of the same owners' recent purchases, English Oak justifying favouritism in the style that you rarely see in these high-level events, looking on his way to pattern company; there are some in behind that can be marked up over the bare result, Carrytheone meeting significant interference and shaping clear second best while in the unfavoured groups, perennial eye-catcher Summerghand did best of those that raced centre-to-far side, though unable to reel back the pair that raced closest to the far rail. | [HORSE]: isn't easy to place off his current mark but this was a much better effort from him back on faster ground."
"Won | [RACE]: This wasn't much of a race beyond the first handful home, but the winner could hardly have done it any easier and blew this field away from the front; the third is worth marking up as he's the only one of the first 4 home not to have spent most of the race on the stand rail. | [HORSE]: back down in trip for handicap debut, was clearly well ahead of opening mark and bolted up, having the stand rail a help but she was simply in a different league to these rivals regardless; made all, went with enthusiasm, went clear over 1f out, won easily; it would make sense to try to find an opportunity under a penalty, the handicapper sure to have a big say after this."
"Won | [RACE]: A blanket finish to a modest affair that developed at a decidely ordinary gallop, the winner doing well to come from off the pace and overcome some trouble in running. | [HORSE]: back up in trip, finally got off the mark on just second start for current yard, looking more straightforward with headgear refitted and value for a bit extra given where he came from and the trouble he encountered; slowly into stride, waited with, travelled well, headway when denied a run over 1f out, switched final 1f, stayed on to lead close home."
"5th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: This is handicap form with a very solid look to it, plenty of in-form sorts in the top half of the field, their efforts backed up by the timefigure. | [HORSE]: is better judged on previous form, an uneconomical effort his undoing on this occasion; dwelt, rushed up around outer and went prominent after 2f/3f, ridden under 3f out, no extra final 1f as earlier exertions told."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modest 3-y-o handicap in which the gallop was steady, resulting in a tight finish, Lunar Rocks in fourth shaping well from a long way back. | [HORSE]: , well beaten in three starts in maiden/novice company, was stepping up from 6f for her handicap debut, and she was blinkered for the first time. Slowly away and towards the back for most of the race, she found her stride inside the last, hinting at better to come, possibly over further."
"9th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: With several interesting sorts on display, this looks a strong piece of handicap form for the grade. | [HORSE]: had been shaping well of late and can have a line put through this run; dwelt, raced off the pace, not clear run over 2f out, never landed a blow."
"3rd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary turnout for the prize money on offer, that probably a consequence of there being one worth 3 times this elsewhere the previous day, the sole 3-y-o having too much for over some in-form, albeit exposed types. | [HORSE]: whose Stewards' Cup fourth had been franked the previous day, was easy to back but remains in good form nonetheless; held up, headway under pressure 2f out, chased leader 1f out, one paced; it's possible he's best in a big-field scenario where he can be covered up for as long as possible (holds an Ayr Gold Cup entry)."
"4th of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steadily-run nursery controlled by the winner, 5 of the 6 in a bit of a heap at the line and the form having a rather muddling look to it. | [HORSE]: looked on a fair mark on his nursery debut even from out of the handicap but wasn't seen to best effect, up against it trying to come from last in a falsely-run race; slowly into stride, held up, effort out wide over 2f out, chased leaders briefly final 1f, no further impression; he'll get in lower-grade nurseries and it'll be a surprise if he isn't winning soon."
"5th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Few got involved after a messy tape start - the stalls had been damaged earlier on the card - left half the field firmly on the back foot in a well-run race. | [HORSE]: probably remains in form, seeming to stay the trip after having been the chief cause of the messy start; spooked by rival jinking right as tape went back and dived further right, raced off the pace, kept on from 2f out, never on terms."
"10th of 20, well beaten | [RACE]: A big field unsurprisingly resulted in an open event, particularly with unexposed sorts thin on the ground, but it still produced a fairly wide-margin winner, the 4-y-o favourite seeing it out in good style from a pair who'd fallen in the weights; just like the remainder of the races on the round course it paid to be handy, only a pair from off the pace finishing in the top 10, though unlike those earlier events this unfolded more towards the stand rail and those who raced wide were therefore not at a disadvantage. | [HORSE]: has developed into a likeable sort and is best not judged on this run on his return to turf; raced off the pace, ridden under 3f out, steady headway from 2f out, never involved, not ideally placed."
"6th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A fair handicap that was run at a strong pace and set up for those that raced in the second half of the field, Dream of Mischief finding this company liberating having been kept to a higher grade for most of his career; there was some trouble on the rail as Dark Rosa made up some ground, Sunshine Mag and Al Waqidi both losing all chance in the incident. | [HORSE]: in a change of headgear, shaped pretty well considering he was out of his grade (4 lb out of the handicap) and did too much too soon; disputed lead, took strong hold, went on before halfway, headed over 1f out, weakened; there will be more suitable opportunities for him to get his head back in front this winter."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap which saw the winner capitalise on a falling mark from the front whilst a couple got in each other's way in behind. | [HORSE]: a C&D winner on stable debut the previous week, failed to settle but ran well under his penalty having been tapped for toe at a crucial stage. A stronger gallop would have suited and he'd be interesting from a 2lb lower mark before he's next reassessed."
"9th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: This looked an unappealing contest beforehand and there's little in how it panned out to think differently, the first 2 having long been in possession of a Timeform squiggle, the pair of them coming from off the pace in a soundly-run affair. | [HORSE]: was back at the scene of his sole win this year but it's easy to put a line through this run; slowly into stride, raced well off the pace, effort on inner 3f out, denied a run over 2f out, no chance after."
"7th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: Conditions can perhaps provide excuses for a couple of the beaten runners, though the market support towards the first 3 home gives the form a solid look nonetheless, the easy winner on his way to more valuable Saturday handicaps. | [HORSE]: who had won both previous outings on heavy ground, shaped as if in good form for the bulk of the contest, though his response off the bridle was disappointing; prominent, travelled fluently, challenged 2f out, found less than looked likely and not perservered with once held."
"4th of 7, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Fairly useful form from the pair that came clear in this 3-y-o handicap, the thriving winner always going well and handling more testing conditions to bring up the hat-trick. | [HORSE]: still seems to be learning his trade and the steady gallop hardly looked in his favour, seemingly losing touch 2f out before his stamina started to kick in; in rear, went in snatches, struggling 2f out, switched 1f out, stayed on, nearest at the finish; should be suited by 1½m, and he should improve as he gains experience, his half-brother Cumulonimbus landing his third win of the season from a mark of 95 in a Racing League event later in the day."
"7th of 16, competitive | [RACE]: More a trial for the Silver Cup in truth, none of these rated high enough to have got in last year's Gold version and no more than a fairly useful handicap in its own right, the pace a sound one which meant coming from the second half of the field was an advantage, Ramiro sweeping through to look a comfortable winner despite being out of the handicap, with Aberama Gold shaping well as best of those that raced close up; the field raced as one down the centre with the exception of the pair that brought up the rear. | [HORSE]: wasn't in quite the same form as last time, when he'd finished just ahead of the second; mid-field, pushed along soon after halfway, not quicken."
"Won | [RACE]: A soundly-run sprint handicap thanks to Horse Whisperer who looked to make every yard, but she was run down late by a handicap debutant who came from well off the pace, with little separating a bunch in behind. | [HORSE]: had shown some promise in 3 runs as a juvenile and was much improved to get off the mark on handicap bow after 6 months off (gelded in interim), the race setting up nicely for him but clearly ahead of his opening mark; dropped out, travelled well, short of room over 2f out, shaken up soon after, still quite a bit to do approaching final 1f, found plenty to lead final 100 yds, soon clear; is open to further improvement and will be one to keep on side next time."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: Just like the earlier 1¼m race on the card, this was completely taken apart by a 3-y-o having his first experience of testing ground, First Officer always going best at the head affairs and soon clear once kicking on 3f out. | [HORSE]: back in a far more competitive race than the 5-runner seller he'd won at Hamilton, didn't get home having failed to settle; raced wide, mid-division, took strong hold, wandered over 2f out, bumped soon after, folded."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap won by a thriving sort that was well backed, Covert Mission also deserving extra credit given he was always up with a strong pace. | [HORSE]: stayed on nicely to take second and, while a bit flattered to get as close as he did to the winner, has dropped to a good mark and will remain dangerous in the short term."
"Won | [RACE]: A miserable turnout numerically for the grade/money but the favourite would have been interesting in a far deeper race and was value for extra over the result in managing to run down the dictating second having looked in big trouble approaching the final 1f. | [HORSE]: confirmed promise of his last run and was value for extra over the result, conceding first run to the dictating second yet managing to run him down in the shadow of the post, doubtful he's shown all he can for this yard after just a couple of outings; patiently ridden, pushed along 3f out, still plenty to do approaching final 1f, stayed on to lead post."
"9th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: Quite an interesting race for the grade, 6 of the 10 having finished first or second on their previous start, and it threw up a ready winner, Surprise Picture never far away before going clear in the straight, a trio from the back coming through to chase him home. | [HORSE]: really easy to back, fared no better than last time; mid-division, lost place when hung right/carried head bit awkwardly 2f out, dropped away."
"2nd of 10, competitive | [RACE]: One of the two 4-y-os took a step forward, Filly One the least exposed in the line-up and bursting clear as she got back on the up with an emphatic success in a strongly-run race. | [HORSE]: , again prominent in the betting, is proving frustrating for his new trainer but this effort strongly suggests he isn't one to give up on just yet. Poorly positioned as things panned out, he surged through the field to take second but the winner, who is potentially much better than her mark, was out of sight. He can gain compensation soon."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A tight finish to this fillies' handicap, the winner returning to form to just hold on, while the third is worth marking up a touch given where she raced in relation to the front pair. | [HORSE]: again ran well and is worthy of a bit of extra credit as she was on the near wing away from the front pair; bumped start, raced off the pace, ridden 2f out, headway over 1f out, edged right and kept on final 1f; still relatively unexposed, she shouldn't be too long breaking her duck."
"16th of 29, well beaten | [RACE]: With as many as 18 making their handicap debut this was unsurprisingly a deep contest, as it usually is, 7 of the first 10 doing so with the front pair taking their form to a smart level, the winner looking a group performer in an event that takes a little bit of explaining; they split into 2 groups with the 11 lowest drawn runners going far side, that contingent slightly ahead at halfway, though it was the stand-side group who came firmly to the fore, providing the first 7 home, with Magical Sunset best of the other side, the majority from that group either worth marking up or best excused the run, some also meeting trouble; the pace was a strong one with both sets of leaders going off too hard and it suited the closers, both Candle of Hope and Novus worth marking up considerably from those ridden prominently, winners bound to come from this. | [HORSE]: backed at long odds in first-time cheekpieces, is best not judged on this run; raced near side, prominent, ridden 3f out, left behind over 1f out, raced closer to pace than ideal."
"3rd of 16, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap that was taken apart by one making his debut in this sphere, Isle of Jura set to win by several lengths until heavily eased and clearly one to follow as he climbs the ranks; the frame was completed by a couple who arrived in good form and Outgun, who would probably have finished second granted a clear run, this trio, along with the timefigure, adding weight to the idea this is strong form. | [HORSE]: in first-time cheekpieces, was placed again and deserves credit for consistency, perhaps making his effort earlier than ideal on this occasion as well, bearing in mind the headwind; prominent, led 2f out, headed over 1f out, left behind by winner final 1f, no extra."
"6th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap dominated by 3-y-os, a 100/1 chance making all and clinging on from the odds-on favourite who got going just too late. | [HORSE]: back on all-weather, wasn't seen to best effect and has better performances in her if she settles down; raced wide, held up, pulled hard, headway 1f out, plugged on, left poorly placed."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Just a modest nursery, though the majority are still unexposed and the first 4 all improved, Secret Testimony causing a shock with the favourite rather throwing the race away having come through to lead inside the final 1f. | [HORSE]: ran best race switched to a nursery despite taking a long time to settle in first-time blinkers; dwelt, raced off the pace, took strong hold, pushed along over 2f out, headway over 1f out, ran on; there's a race of this nature in her if she can be chanelled more efficiently."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: Quite an open looking contest beforehand, the race pepped up by a handful of less exposed 3-y-os, though the one that came out on top wasn't heralded by the market, the form potentially muddling, with plenty pulling hard early and then the leaders kicking on too soon, the first 3 all coming from the back of the field in the straight, the race a rough one there as well. | [HORSE]: who had form figures of 21312 in handicaps prior to this, suffered his second short price reversal in as many runs, trapped wider than ideal and refusing to settle."
"10th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A weak affair which saw a 3-way go for the lead and a bit of trouble towards the inner in the straight, the first 3 all coming down the wide outside with the winner causing a shock at 100/1. | [HORSE]: can have a line put through this run; in touch, raced freely, badly hampered after 1f, lost place, made little impression after."
"3rd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive 3-y-o event that contained no less than 5 last-time-out winners, though none of those could follow up, the likeable Haunted Dream resuming winning ways in gritty fashion; the pace was only fair and it produced a rather bunched finish which puts a slight dampener on the form, though it should still work out. | [HORSE]: who was running from 3lb out of the handicap, ran a big race, staying on from well back to be nearest at the finish. She might have had even more of a say had she not hampered her cause by hanging left all the way up the straight. The longer distance suited and she's open to improvement now she's found her trip."
"Won | [RACE]: A well-run event that included plenty of interesting 3-y-os and a pair who improved were split by one who's fallen in the weights, the front-running third probably kicking on sooner than ideal, the form likely to prove solid. | [HORSE]: one of the least exposed on this handicap debut, came out of the pack to hunt the leader down, staying on well to hit the front inside the last before idling close home. He looked value for more than the winning margin and while he'd have claims in the Old Rowley Cup, the November Handicap might be a better fit."
"4th of 5, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A one-sided nursery, the progressive winner completing a hat-trick with plenty in hand, not much to be overly positive about amongst the rest. | [HORSE]: who had hinted at temperament last time, completely let himself down over 1f longer trip on nursery debut, proving virtually unrideable under pressure and very much one to be wary of now; held up, headway out wide over 2f out, hung right home turn, swerved badly right again final 1f, not recover; ungenuine."
"10th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Despite the leader going off hard, not many got into this ordinary handicap, the back-to-form winner never far away and just holding on from a well-backed one who's on a fair mark. | [HORSE]: ran poorly, connections reporting he failed to face the first-time blinkers (also lost a shoe), though he's hardly one for maximum faith in any case; dwelt, raced off the pace, took strong hold, typically carried head high, never on terms."
"2nd of 16, involved in finish | [RACE]: Although the overall time was slightly slower than the preceding class 2, this was run at a far stronger gallop and appeals as particularly solid form for the level, the winner one of the least exposed and she was chased home by a trio who'd all won at least their last 2 starts. | [HORSE]: seeking a quickfire hat-trick, was swinging on the bridle 2f out before knuckling down once pressed and headed by the winner. He still looks capable of winning again from this revised mark."
"6th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A mid-level handicap of late changing fortunes, the one played last and widest of all picking them up after the aggressively-ridden True Courage had shaped the race by committing further out than necessary. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form, having next to nothing go right in the race; in touch, not settle fully, going well when denied a run from 3f out, got gap only final 1f, no chance after, not persevered with once held."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful handicap that saw Crowd Quake record a remarkable eighth success of the campaign, a couple who hit the frame looking like they’d drop away before rallying to good effect. | [HORSE]: without headgear this time and on appreciably more testing ground than previously, wasted no time getting back to form as he proved his stamina for this far, though did make rather heavy weather of it having looked to be going nowhere at one point; dwelt, mid-field, shaken up under 4f out, hung left around 3f out, struggling 2f out, rallied final 1f, nearest at the finish."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: With several interesting sorts on display, this looks a strong piece of handicap form for the grade. | [HORSE]: strong in the betting, was arguably unlucky not to win, the longer trip posing no problems; waited with, travelled well, headway when short of room over 1f out, switched inside final 1f, ran on; he's worth backing to make amends next time."
"3rd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: With relatively unexposed fillies in 3 of the first 4 places, this strikes as strong form for the level, while the other in the frame was coming into it having had a good year. | [HORSE]: whose four wins this year include one over C&D, is prone to the occasional slow start and it cost her here. She is capable of winning off this career-high mark, but can't afford to give away ground."
"Won | [RACE]: A fair handicap, the 3-y-o winner possessing an unexposed profile for her new yard and she left the impression she had more in hand than the bare result, quickening up to edge a bunched finish close home. | [HORSE]: hit top gear inside the final furlong and got up to defy a 6lb hike in the handicap. She once again took an age to settle, but is now 2-2 for Mick Appleby and an addition of a hood has evidently done the trick. There's likely more to come yet."
"Won | [RACE]: The front runner went off way too hard but others were caught out of their ground, and the winner - who was prominent in the main group - was in no danger once taking the lead in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: back up in trip, defied a mark 9 lb lower than his last winning one back under the 7-lb claimer who usually rides him, always having the tearaway leader in his sights and the only one that ever looked like getting to that rival; prominent main group, chased leader out wide early in straight, led final 1f, soon clear; he'll remain with some handicapping scope."
"Won | [RACE]: Quite a valuable race for the time of year which attracted a maximum field, and though a few weren't seen to best effect in a race run at an ordinary gallop, including most of those who were held up, this is still a race to watch in the coming weeks, the winner clearly very well suited to all-weather and chased home by some well-treated and/or in-form rivals. | [HORSE]: back down in grade, wasted no time getting back to winning ways, helped by a dream run up the inner in the straight but still worth crediting with a decidedly useful effort; mid-field, travelled smoothly (bit keen in early stages), steady headway straight, stayed on to lead final 100 yds; he's thriving at present and will be one to consider if taking up his entry at Newcastle in the coming days, for all that he'll probably need another step forward if he's to defy a penalty."
"5th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A very messy finish to this nursery with several meeting severe interference over 1f out as Dragon Spin veered off a true path, the winner avoiding the worst of it, with the third, fourth and seventh the chief sufferers. | [HORSE]: with a hood added, looked far from straightforward."
"9th of 20, well beaten | [RACE]: This looked a really tight affair on paper but fitness seemed an issue for many, particularly in a soundly-run race, though not so the well-backed winner who took a big step forward on first start for new connections. | [HORSE]: was quite tight in the betting but shaped as if better for the run after 6 months off; tracked pace, took keen hold, close up 3f out, faded under 2f out while seeming to want to lug right, not knocked about."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A borderline fairly useful apprentice handicap in which it paid to be handy, a pair of lightly-raced 3-y-os coming to the fore, and it was Havana Pursuit who dug deep to come out on top. | [HORSE]: was ridden more prominently than previously and ran best race sporting first-time headgear after 3 months off; led, edged left soon after start (jockey suspended for 4 days for careless riding), took keen hold, went clear briefly 2f out, pushed along soon after, tackled well inside final 1f, headed close home; the vet reported he was showing signs of heat stress post race but provided he's given time to get over these exertions, it shouldn't be long before he goes one better."
"2nd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: An amateur handicap that would almost certainly have gone the runner-up's way had he encountered a smoother passage, though it wasn't as if Triple Force was winning out of turn, recording a third career success after shaping well on his previous outing. | [HORSE]: who won this race 2 years earlier, wasted no time getting back to form returned to less testing ground after 8 weeks off, looking unlucky not to win given the interference he met; held up, tanked along (not settle fully early without customary hood ), headway on bridle when met some trouble 2f out, snatched up over 1f out and forced to switch, kept on well."
"Won | [RACE]: A useful handicap that went to an unexposed sort, Zoffandia doing well to quicken past a couple of better-placed rivals who arrived in good nick, whilst the fourth also deserves some extra credit given how this developed, the gallop only really picking up from 3f out. | [HORSE]: belied market weakness, proving a different proposition on handicap debut and value for a bit extra on top of the bare margin, having come from further back than the placed pair; dwelt, mid-field, went with zest, shaken up over 2f out, switched under 2f out, quickened to lead final 100 yds, edged right but won readily; already looks well bought on the back of this and may have more to offer."
"6th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A notably valuable handicap by 0-80 standards and surely solid form for the grade, the winner back to his very best of late and digging deep to fend off a couple of 3-y-os and one that's been on a winning streak; a good early pace steadied noticeably early in the back straight. | [HORSE]: was notably easy to back and disappointed in a major way (had both Pons Aelius and First Officer behind him when winning at Sandown), acknowledging he lost a shoe and the longer trip may not have been in his favour given the way he raced; held up, took strong hold, left behind from 3f out."
"Won | [RACE]: Reasonable form for the grade as far as those in the places are concerned, the thriving winner completing the hat-trick from an in-form pair, the third having raced on the outer wing in a contest which unfolded towards the near side, a high draw not the usual disadvantage as a result. | [HORSE]: is in the form of her life and, down in grade, completed the hat-trick with a bit to spare; mid-field, headway under pressure 2f out, led entering final 1f, won cosily; she'll take all the beating next time in such a rich vein of form."
"3rd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that was run at a strong gallop, Kalganov just holding on from a fast finisher who typically looked awkward. | [HORSE]: in first-time cheekpieces, was returned to 7f and got back on the up, little wrong with his application this time, doing well under the circumstances in fact given he was best of those close up in a strongly-run race; chased leaders, travelled well, shaken up over 2f out, led over 1f out, edged out only late on."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap on balance which look set to go the way of Laura Bay as she loomed up 2f out, but the winner handles these conditions well and returned to form from out of the blue to edge her out, the third catching the eye with a strong finish further back. | [HORSE]: up 4lb for a nose defeat at Leicester in September, has done very little wrong since going handicapping and she travelled much the best, only to be chinned late on. She'll go up again once reassessed, which will frustrate her connections."
"14th of 17, well beaten | [RACE]: A race dominated by those drawn low who raced towards the far side, the winner proven in testing conditions and not for catching having made all the running, though this is hardly form to hang your hat on with those in double-figure stalls effectively having little chance the way it panned out, Irish Nectar in fifth shaping well with that in mind. | [HORSE]: shaped as if needing the run on first outing since leaving Francis-Henri Graffard for €25,000 after 3 months off, also not ideally positioned towards the raced near side; prominent, weakened over 1f out."
"Won | [RACE]: A well-contested 3-y-o event, albeit one that lacked unexposed sorts, the progressive winner one of only a couple of notable exceptions; the field was fanned across the track and those who raced towards the near wing seemed unfavoured, the runner-up the only one to challenge from that contingent. | [HORSE]: again tended to wander for pressure but there was no questioning his application off the bridle, gutsing this out for a second success and a first on turf. He'll likely progress again."
"Won | [RACE]: The favourite was a touch disappointing but the first 2 are progressive sorts, the winner doing well to overcome trouble in running. | [HORSE]: overcame adversity to record a fourth win from eight starts, rallying strongly inside the final furlong after being hampered by Thundering under 2f from home. He is versatile in terms of underfoot conditions (turf or AW), but it's relevant to note that he was said to have appreciated the smaller field scenario when winning at Kempton previously."
"6th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: This was run at an unsustainable early gallop under the conditions, the riders on the early pacesetters getting it horribly wrong and the field coming back at distances more akin to a long-distance chase at Hexham than a Flat handicap, Zikany benefiting from the kind of quiet, energy-saving ride that Charlie Deutsch is known for over jumps as he repeated his victory in the race 2 yrs earlier. | [HORSE]: had finished runner-up on heavy ground at Chester earlier in the season, but his turf win came on a faster surface and he didn't look happy on the deeper ground this time."
"5th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A really messy contest in behind, several coming close together in the finish and a couple appeared to finish with some running left, Gidwa just doing things more efficiently than most; the pace was modest. | [HORSE]: ran best race despite not being seen to best effect, left poorly placed; held up, headway when short of room 1f out, kept on, finished with running left; will be suited by a return to 1m and may yet prove up to winning a similar race."
"9th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A fair handicap that not many got into, the winner quickly back on track following a lesser effort. | [HORSE]: on first outing since leaving Tim Easterby (5,500 gns), is best not judged on this run, his blindfold removed late and rearing at the start; raced off the pace, never landed a blow."
"7th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Hard to think this is anything other than really solid form for the grade, plenty of recent winning form on offer, with 3 of the more interesting ones coming clear in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect; awkward leaving stalls, held up, switched off inside over 3f out, met some trouble over 2f out, headway soon after, not quicken final 1f; he looks well treated on the form of his close second here before his break, that having come over 1½m."
"4th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: A soundly-run affair that produced a surprise winner, Whitcombe Rockstar well on top of the well-backed favourite at the line, the pair of them having raced right up the inside, the winner having a big gap at the cutaway whereas Dembe came between horses and was held up in beginning his challenge for a brief while. | [HORSE]: was able to cross over just in time to avoid having a three-wide trip on the bend. He ran well considering he went without the declared tongue-tie, backing up his reappearance run at Lingfield."
"2nd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A somewhat messy handicap given the early interference, the runner-up one of the chief sufferers, but the winner still impressed in showing the rest a clean pair of heels. | [HORSE]: was all but knocked over at the first bend, so it was a commendable effort from her to go so close. She's admirably consistent (her previous six starts earning RPRs of between 74 and 76) and could have a profitable time of it if kept going over the winter."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: This was run at a much stronger gallop than the class 2 handicap a little earlier on the card and strikes as very solid form for the level, a pair of three-year-olds sandwiching a 5-y-o lurking on a handy mark, the winner toughing it out well having gone on over 3f out. | [HORSE]: was unlucky not to finish closer and is threatening to come good soon; mid-division, no room 3f out, shuffled back a bit and forced to switch, forced to switch again 2f out, not clear run once more inside final 1f, finished with running left; she's one to look out for."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: Plenty weren't seen to best effect in a soundly-run nursery, the first 2 making their efforts more towards the stand side and avoiding the scrimmaging that hampered several of their rivals, a couple shaping well enough to warrant being on the shortlist for similar events next time. | [HORSE]: showed improved form despite losing momentum at a crucial stage, catching the eye with the way he recovered late on; waited with, headway when forced to switch over 1f out, kept on well final 100 yds."
"3rd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: Strong form for the grade, and though it was well-run, it was dominated by a pair on the front end, the never-nearer third not seen to best effect after suffering a wide trip but also looking a little short of pace under these conditions. | [HORSE]: well backed, shaped a fair bit better than the bare result again, but seems to need a stiffer test of stamina than this provided; held up, outpaced 3f out, switched 2f out, headway out wide over 1f out, challenged final 1f, edged right, no extra late on, not ideally placed; he'll be suited by a return to 7f and there are handicaps to be won with him."
"8th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Similar to most of the other sprints on the card, it proved hard to get involved from too far back - largely due to a tailwind - and the thriving winner made all, the sympathetically-ridden Gizelles Izzy one to note from the rear. | [HORSE]: very much caught the eye back up in trip; in rear, shaken up over 2f out, steady progress approaching final 1f, never dangerous but considerately handled and finished with plenty of running left; she's only ever won at Hamilton on turf and is one to look out for when back at that venue, especially in this grade."
"Won | [RACE]: A typically strong running of the Buckingham Palace, the meeting all the better for its reintroduction in 2020, but for the third year in a row it was dominated by those drawn high, the action unfolding right up the near rail, much like in the Britannia over an hour earlier, the winner seen to something like maximum effect for all this Group-class effort has foundation, felt good enough to contest the Jersey at this meeting last year and one of a number to reap the benefit of a switch from the retired Sir Michael Stoute into a new yard this year. | [HORSE]: sixth in last year's Jersey Stakes for Sir Michael Stoute, had gained a career best on his debut for Andrew Balding following a gelding operation in May when second to Myal, which promoted the son of No Nay Never to be a market leader for the Wokingham at that stage, and he won this in the manner of one both way in front of his mark and the style of a Pattern race performer. He is, however, in the Bunbury Cup and International Handicap, which is over this C&D next month."
"9th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: As with the Sprint Cup around half an hour earlier, the stand-side rail proved a big advantage, the speedy winner grabbing it early and dominating from the front, though whether his performance is quite as good as it seems at first glance is open to debate given the favourable circumstances. | [HORSE]: can have a line put through this run, awkwardly away having got upset in the stalls and always behind after."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sprint handicap that was run at a modest pace and favoured those that raced close up, the first 2 disputing those placings throughout with the third shaping well from much further back. | [HORSE]: still in last position as the field approached the 1f marker, made good late headway into third in a race in which the speed held up. He's undoubtedly capable of winning off this mark when getting a stronger pace to aim at and a return to Goodwood on September 25, for the 0-80 handicap he won last year, would look the obvious next target."
"2nd of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: As one sided a handicap as likely to be seen on the Flat, Jungle Run soon having the rest out of their comfort zone as they came home at long intervals. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, attracted support and offered something to work on, enough to think he'll win a race or 2 at a lowly level for all he was no match for the winner; chased leaders, ridden soon after halfway, plugged on, pulled clear of remainder."
"5th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A strongly-run handicap which played into the hands of one dropping back in trip, Spirit Genie getting a much clearer run than the unlucky runner-up in the straight. | [HORSE]: was a winner here over slightly further this time last year and wasn't seen to best effect from easing mark, not much going right for him; held up, outpaced when short of room 2f out, rider looked down as if something amiss early in straight, ridden 1f out, late headway; not one to write off."
"Won | [RACE]: Plenty failed to handle the conditions in this 3-y-o handicap, but the winner still deserves crediting with a step forward, ploughing through the mud and drawing away from an in-form rival, who in turn pulled clear of the rest. | [HORSE]: upped in trip and switched to turf, relished the increased emphasis on stamina and showed improved form to get off the mark; close up, upsides over 3f out, went on around 2f out, forged clear; useful pedigree points to ongoing progression."
"Won | [RACE]: There was a bit of early scrimmaging in this fair handicap, the winner clear of it and able to control a modest gallop, with the third shaping better than the bare result having endured a tough trip. | [HORSE]: continues in fine form. He had the run of this, tanking along in front whilst setting modest fractions, and he'll be forced out of this bracket when reassessed, but he's versatile and likeable."
"7th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: A contest with a long tradition but one that has somewhat lost its prestige of late and this looks just ordinary form, a trio of unexposed sorts lining up, including the sole 3-y-o who was sent off a short-priced favourite, but only one of them gave their running, the 2 outsiders producing an exciting finish with the winner proving game; it was a modestly-run affair and there seemed a difference in opinion early in the straight with a quartet coming more towards the centre whilst the remainder stayed near the far rail, the groups merging over 2f out and it was a level playing field. | [HORSE]: was strong in the betting returned to more testing conditions for the first time since routing a field of 3-y-os at Goodwood but proved to be a major disappointment taking on his elders, even after being able to bag an uncontested lead; dictated, at least 4 lengths clear after 3f, reduced advantage home turn, headed over 3f out, left behind from 2f out."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: There wasn't much to separate the principals in this handicap, and those who were dropped right out seemed at a disadvantage, but this is still a race that looks sure to throw up winners, plenty of in-form sorts taking part and a couple of gradually progressive 4-y-os fighting out the finish. | [HORSE]: went with more fluency than last time, despite the drop back in trip, and did well to get as close as he did from an unpromising position; held up, ridden when switched under 2f out, finished well, never nearer, left with a lot to do;. this suggests the handicapper hasn't caught up with him just yet."
"8th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: A handicap with a very Chester feel to it, plenty undone by their position in a race totally dominated by the well-backed winner. | [HORSE]: was able to race from the same mark as last time but can have a line put through this run; raced very wide and forced even wider into first turn, chased leaders, weakening when edged left around 2f out, faded."
"2nd of 10, competitive | [RACE]: A lop-sided betting market and with good reason, too, Golden Shot yet another from his yard to leave earlier form behind faced with a marked increase in trip for his handicap debut, soon in front and never seriously threatened, those that chased him home all having been in good heart at a similar level. | [HORSE]: ran her best race in chasing home a handicap blot, as anticipated benefiting from the step up in trip; mid-field, pushed along over 3f out, stayed on, no match for winner."
"7th of 14, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A large field for a higher-grade sprint handicap, several of these having contested pattern or listed company, the winner last seen in the Middle Park, fitness potentially an issue that might have made the race less competitive, with 10 of the 14 having their first run of the year, though seemingly it turned out not to be a concern for the first 2; the field raced as one group down the centre, the pace a good one, the first 3 coming from off the pace, the winner right from the back of the field, some of those more at the sharp end perhaps better than the result. | [HORSE]: , progressive last year, looked interesting for this reappearance and handicap debut but he proved disappointing, not handling the Dip. He'll be worth another chance back on a more conventional course."
"18th of 18, well beaten | [RACE]: A useful fillies' handicap contested mainly by 3-y-os and it contained several relatively interesting types, plenty of whom finished in the first half of the field, but unsurprisingly for a big field around here it was a race where tactics and track position played a part, several meeting trouble towards the inner as the principals swept down the outer from off a strong gallop. | [HORSE]: after 12 months off, is best not judged on this run; mid-field, headway 3f out, switched soon after, badly hampered 2f out, lost place, not recover."
"Won | [RACE]: A lazy display by the odds-on winner, his rider's attempt to kill the race off leading to a slow-motion finish. | [HORSE]: up 3lb, with cheekpieces replacing blinkers, looked a hard ride, pushed along from an early stage, but he did enough despite going both ways under pressure, notching his second win. This wasn't a strong race and he had the run of it but he's a lazy sort who is all about stamina and may do better granted a suitable test."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A muddling handicap which saw the winner end a long losing run faced with a slightly easier assignment than he'd been tasked with in the last couple of years, edging out one that is going through an excellent spell, while the fourth caught the eye on reappearance; the pace was on the modest side and not much separated the first 6. | [HORSE]: travelled into contention going best but the winner just leaned in on him a little and he couldn't get past. He entered the race in fine form, having won three straight, and could yet have more to offer."
"7th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: A notably tight finish for a staying handicap on bad ground, though it's not as if they dawdled, Land of Winter attempting and failing to run the finish out of his rivals. | [HORSE]: has been in smashing form on the all-weather but he'd never raced on ground this testing and was patently unsuited by conditions; dropped out, pushed along home turn, beaten when eased from 3f out."
"7th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that went the way of a lightly-raced improver, Dr Strangelove doing much better than on his handicap debut, though the field were in a heap in behind and with neither the favourite or second favourite seen to best effect, the form might not be the strongest. | [HORSE]: shaped much better than the bare result for a second start in a row; held up, travelled well, short of room 1f out, forced to switch, kept on, finished with running left under just hands-and-heels ride; there are handicaps to be won with him from this sort of mark."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful and competitive handicap that looks sure to work out despite it proving a little messy in the final 2f of a modestly-run affair, the likeable winner always well placed and seeing off a pair of 3-y-os, the runner-up especially one to be interested in next time, though each of the first 5 will be worth at least a second look in similar events next time. | [HORSE]: had to settle for second once more switched to a handicap but shaped as though she's almost certainly the best handicapped of these, things not panning out so well for her as it had the winner, signs of inexperience still evident too; mid-division, raced freely, not clear run over 2f out, headway when switched over 1f out, hung left approaching final 1f, stayed on; she's one to bet on next time."
"12th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: Four fewer runners than in any other handicap at the meeting but potentially the strongest piece of 3-y-o handicap form of the week, a fast-improving colt saved for this leading home one who'd been placed in group company on his previous 3 starts with further solidity added by the gap back to a third who'd won a handicap at the Guineas meeting, the form underpinned by a sound gallop, the first 2 coming from the rear with the winner forced particularly wide into the straight as he began his challenge. | [HORSE]: on firmer ground than previously, shaped as if amiss; slowly into stride, raced off the pace, effort under 3f out, faltered under 2f out."
"5th of 7, competitive | [RACE]: A contest featuring several in-form sorts and the form has a strong look to it, the placed pair both arriving with recent wins to their name but comfortably brushed aside by a mercurial 5-y-o that still has an air of untapped potential about him. | [HORSE]: up 6lb for a recent 6f course win, raced with the choke out and didn't get home. Although he's a fairly regular winner, his overall form has an uneven look to it."
"6th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: An interesting fillies' handicap that should prove solid form, the winner in good nick right now and better positioned then the second, who finished to good effect on her first start for a new yard, while a couple further back weren't seen to best effect. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect having her first try at 6f, in better heart than recent form figures suggest; rear of mid-field, not settle fully, headway when denied a run 1f out, plugged on final 1f."
"3rd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: This looked an open race on paper lacking progressive standouts, and that was borne out by the bunched finish, things getting messy for one or 2 trapped on the inside as well, the exposed winner making the late-and-wide move that proved a theme on the card. | [HORSE]: has warranted his career-high mark and may yet be able to defy it based on how he shaped in defeat here, placed despite little going right for him as things were unfolding; reared leaving stalls, settled mid-field, going well when denied a run until 2f out, got gap only last ½f, ran on."
"13th of 22, well beaten | [RACE]: A maximum field for the race that brings the curtain down on the Dante Festival and it was a fiercely competitive affair, 5 of them last-time-out winners, and all bar one finished in the first 6; the pace was brisk from the outset and it set up for those from mid-field or further back, veteran Mums Tipple not only faring easily the best of those who raced prominently but best of all, going at least 4 lengths clear at one stage before a penalised pair who’d avoided any trouble by challenging near side short through to wear him down close home, this not anywhere near as messy as the 3-y-o handicap over this trip on Wednesday but it still including a few hard-luck stories, notably the fourth and last year’s winner. | [HORSE]: arrived in better heart than his recent form figures suggested but underperformed; mid-field, ridden 3f out, never involved; type to bounce back quickly."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: An interesting quartet pulled clear in a competitive 3-y-o affair, the field fanned across the track in the straight with that contingent all towards the far wing; it was an exciting finish, the improving We Dare To Dream shifting left near the line and taking the runner-up with him, the narrow margin of victory meaning that the result was overturned. | [HORSE]: gelded since last seen in a strong race at Leicester, was well backed returned to 7f and shaped well, coming from further back than the first 2; held up, headway under pressure 2f out, every chance entering final 1f, kept on; likely to stay 1m and will remain of interest, particularly when taking on his elders."
"6th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that was run at a fair pace, the relatively unexposed Chola Empire getting back on the up with a couple who filled the frame giving the form a reliable look. | [HORSE]: back down in trip, showed more than last time and is perhaps building up to something, down to a tempting mark these days and not long with a yard that usually get such types to come good at some stage; dropped out, shaken up 2f out, kept on, nearest at the finish, considerately handled."
"12th of 14, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A competitive sprint handicap, all the more interesting for the presence of a couple of 3-y-os, one of them a short-priced favourite and running well but unable to hold off a low-mileage 4-y-o; the field raced right across the track with most ridden to their draw, the action unfolding towards the centre to far side with those drawn high probably best not judged too harshly. | [HORSE]: can have a line put through this run given where he was drawn; mid-field, pushed along before halfway, weakened inside final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: Those that raced off the pace struggled to land a blow, but is still took a fairly useful performance by the winner to narrowly see off a pair on fair marks at present. | [HORSE]: third at Windsor a fortnight earlier, form which had been franked, made the most of his high draw, just holding on. This was just his second turf win and, potentially helped by track position here, he wouldn't make strong appeal to follow up."
"13th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: A steadily-run and ordinary affair that hinged on the respective runs through of the first 2 home in the latter stages, the result sure to have been different had George Ridsdale enjoyed the clear run from which Come To Pass benefited. | [HORSE]: didn't look in any sort of form returning from a further 11 weeks off; tracked pace, pushed along 3f out, dropped away quickly from 2f out."
"Won | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap, the gambled-on winner always well placed and holding a couple of closers with plenty more in hand than margin indicates. | [HORSE]: a winner at Dundalk for Joseph O'Brien in first-time cheekpieces in January, had been well held in both starts in handicaps since returning for this yard in August, but he got back on track. He impressed with the way he travelled and also with the way he quickened away in the last furlong. The winning margin doesn't do him justice and he should be able to build on this."
"5th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A fair handicap, the feature of which was a strong pace, the first 2 coming from rear with the third doing best of the prominent racers. | [HORSE]: reverted to waiting tactics and although he kept on late, was never getting there quickly enough. He is 6lb lower than when winning over C&D 11 months ago so is well treated for when things do fall into place."
"7th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: Probably quite a good piece of form for the level, 4 of the septet running from the ceiling mark of 88, 3 of whom came a little way clear, with the first 2 the least exposed in the race; the pace was fair. | [HORSE]: has completely lost his way; raced off the pace, dropped to last when hung right leaving back straight, well beaten 3f out."
"4th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A basement-level sprint, but at least it went the way of one who arrived in decent nick; the field congregated towards the stand-side rail. | [HORSE]: looked set to finish nearer last than first for much of the journey, but she responded generously to pressure in her first-time cheekpieces inside the final furlong. She's never won beyond this trip, but shapes as though six will be more to her liking."
"Won | [RACE]: Traditionally a strong handicap, though notably testing conditions obviously played a major part in the outcome this time round, a handicap debutant grabbing the favoured stand rail and pulling well clear of a trio of last-time-out winners. | [HORSE]: on much more testing ground than previously, proved a different proposition on handicap debut, powering clear once grabbing the favoured stand rail to record a wide-margin success upped slightly further in trip, the first leg of a double on the card for the yard; handy, taken back to mid-field halfway, headway to lead under 3f out, wandered under 2f out, went clear 1f out, kept going well; he's due a steep rise in the weights now and has to prove he's as effective under less testing conditions, but that's not to say this form shouldn't be taken at face value for the time being."
"3rd of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: This looked a competitive early-season 3-y-o sprint handicap but it was blown apart by recent course winner Hammer The Hammer who was soon in front and never looked in any danger; the form is very much backed up by the time, the winner quicker than Prince of Pillo in the equivalent older horse event that followed. | [HORSE]: can have this upgraded a little as he made a big from from the back before that effort petered out. He's worth another chance."
"7th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap with just over a length covering the first 6 at the line, the top-weight doing well in overcoming a pace bias to record his third all-weather success of the year. | [HORSE]: returned to form and would have finished closer still if not for being squeezed out and stumbling late on, though he had benefited from being allowed to set a steady pace; led, headed briefly 3f out, ridden under 3f out, headed over 1f out, keeping on when badly hampered final 50 yds."
"4th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: It was all change late on in this near useful handicap, the lead changing hands 3 times in the final 1f with the in-form winner getting up in the final strides. | [HORSE]: made a promising start to his handicap career on the back of last month's 7f course novice success, finishing off well considering he was quite keen trapped wide throughout. There are bigger performances in him."
"Won | [RACE]: Yet another competitive-looking handicap proved rather less so such was the dominance of a clear-cut winner who'd also won at Hamilton in the first meeting of this year's Sunday Series, the result a reflection on his progress more than a knock on the tightly-congested group that followed him home; a couple of the customary front runners found themselves further back than usual but Global Spirit ensured it was a briskly-run affair. | [HORSE]: is suddenly a fast improver, facing the second/third from Hamilton on worse terms yet upholding that form - with even more in hand, such a margin of victory in a very competitive handicap not to be understated; tracked pace, typically took strong hold (very free briefly early), going well when produced to lead under 2f out, asserted quickly, won readily; another Sunday Series success will net connections a £100,000 bonus, which could well be on the cards given his rate of progress."
"Won | [RACE]: A valuable and useful staying handicap that was torn apart by the well-backed favourite, so many going up and down on the same spot from early in the straight whilst Divine Comedy was asserting whilst still hard on the bridle, the emphasis on stamina right up her street. | [HORSE]: confirmed promise of reappearance and more as she justified strong support in impressive fashion, relishing the emphasis on stamina back at 2m and having things in hand a long way from home; prominent, tanked along, led on bridle approaching straight, went clear from 2f out, eased final 100 yds and value for another couple of lengths; she faces a hefty rise in the weights for this and connections will probably be tempted to look for black type for her at some point as a result, maybe worth keeping her fresh for the back-end given how effective she is on testing ground."
"5th of 21, competitive | [RACE]: The sprint track at York has tended to offer a significant advantage to those drawn low this season, to the extent that jockeys were riding to mitigate that here, the field coming pretty much as one down the middle to far side which meant thie bias wasn't so pronounced and single-figure stalls filled only 2 of the first 13 places, trouble in running a factor for some of those drawn low, Secret Guest and The Green Man wiped out before halfway and things getting tight for others inside the final 1f, Strike Red already having put the race to bed at that point, bagging the valuable prize he'd threatened at several points this year. | [HORSE]: got back on track under conditions that seem to suit him much better than those he encountered at Ayr, but faced a difficult task in trying to make all in a race like this; led, pushed along around halfway, headed over 1f out, plugged on."
"3rd of 17, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sextet arrived on the back of at least one win and a couple from that group - both chasing a hat-trick - came from behind in a well-run race to come a little way clear of a rival adding to a promising start for a new yard, all suggestive of another strong Sunday Series handicap. | [HORSE]: seems to be building up to something for his new yard, trouble in running preventing him reaping full benefit of the return to 2m, unlucky not to finish closer; in rear, headway when not clear run over 2f out, forced to switch again 1f out, kept on well inside final 1f, took third near line, finished with running left without having come under maximum pressure; he wore blinkers for his 3 wins last year."
"Won | [RACE]: A nursery blown apart by a big improver, those who did best of the rest all making their efforts towards the centre of the track. | [HORSE]: showed much improved form to get off the mark after 5 months off, a gelding operation a possible catalyst along with a positive ride and the fitting of headgear (first-time hood and tongue strap); soon led, travelled strongly, quickened clear from 2f out, comfortably; he'll be of interest if found an opportunity before being reassessed."
"Won | [RACE]: A useful handicap but another tactical affair on the round course that saw the progressive winner doing well to run down one who dictated and was stepping up in trip having run in the Lockinge two starts back. | [HORSE]: is from the family of Ghaiyyath and looked sure to appreciate the step up in trip, which he did, albeit in a race run at a steady pace. He benefited from his rider's 5lb claim on top of the weight for age allowance, but this was still a pleasing effort from a lightly raced improver."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sound gallop saw the field soon quite well strung out, the pace steadying only briefly after halfway, and it set up well for a veteran to come from the back. | [HORSE]: is a 3-time winner over hurdles (including last month) but is a maiden on the Flat and will always be a risky proposition in this sphere; mid-field, chased leaders 3f out, led when hung left over 2f out, headed around 1f out, kept on."
"5th of 18, competitive | [RACE]: A competitive sprint handicap, the first pair were both running off career-low marks, with the winner a recent stable switcher; the action took place from the centre to the stand side of the track. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect as a result of his blindfold being removed late; held up, pushed along under 3f out, stayed on."
"5th of 7, competitive | [RACE]: Everything bar the winner was stepping up in trip and a couple of the leading contenders raced freely in a modestly-run race, the form hard to rate particularly high in the circumstances. | [HORSE]: couldn't receive maximum assistance from his rider as the saddle slipped early on. He should better this handicap debut form next time."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modest contest that was run at a fair gallop, one with more potential than most at this level getting up late after the runner-up hung across to the far rail. | [HORSE]: in first-time blinkers, threw this away by drifting markedly left, ending up on the far rail. She has shown a tendency to go left in previous starts and this trait will likely hold back any progression."
"5th of 15, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that produced a tight finish, though it did prove something of a 'draw' race, those in double-figure stalls struggling to make much of an impact, the first 5 home all from the low numbers and well positioned towards the far side, the effort of Boyne Lady in sixth well worth marking up given her draw/where she raced. | [HORSE]: wasn't disgraced seeking a hat-trick under a penalty, particularly considering she was posted a little bit away from the other principals early on, worth treating as if still at the top of her game; in touch towards centre, headway 2f out, edged left, no extra final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: Run at a true tempo with the least exposed member of the field running out a clear winner form a pair in good nick, this is a result that has a solid look to it, for all admittedly few of the others aren't of particular interest. | [HORSE]: had been knocking on the door and showed improved form to get off the mark, finding things really clicking in a well-run race dropped slightly in trip; waited with, travelled fluently, going well when denied a run around 2f out, switched, headway to lead over 1f out, forged clear; she'll be hit quite hard for thrashing a pair who were both well-in, but she's still low mileage and could have more to offer in a similarly well-run race."
"5th of 22, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap as competitive as the field size suggests though it was full of consistent rather than highly-progressive sorts and it was relatively trouble free, the winner one that had to weave through but able to get up on the line from one that was up there throughout, while the fifth caught the eye further back from the worst of the draw. | [HORSE]: , representing a trainer in fine form, was a market mover on and he shaped well. Out the back 2f out, he still looked green when asked for his effort but he was keeping on steadily despite traffic issues. It's possible he's not straightforward but he looks worth another go at a mile and can win races off his mark."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Useful efforts from the first 2 in an open-looking handicap, just a neck between them at the line after they'd raced at opposite ends of the field. | [HORSE]: had conditions to suit and he ran a fine race but also showed his darker side, typically slowly away and then hanging badly to his left in the final furlong. That manoeuvre did Bigbertiebassett no favours and Kieran Shoemark picked up a two-day ban for careless riding."
"7th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: The headwind was at its strongest by this stage of the card and it typically favoured those held up, the pair that headed the betting racing on the outer flank and faring much better than the result suggests. | [HORSE]: shaped better than the distance beaten suggests, briefly throwing down a challenge before a combination of his exuberance and not getting shelter from the strong headwind on the far flank took its toll; dwelt, raced off the pace, pulled hard, rapid headway under 3f out, threatened 2f out, beaten when hung left 1f out, eased."
"3rd of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A useful handicap run in deteriorating conditions with the winning margins exaggerated at the line, flattering the first 2 a little on the day, though Rhoscolyn's victory can be easily explained all the same, stepping up on a more recent encouraging effort having tumbled down the handicap; the field again made a beeline for the stands rail, those challenging near to it doing best. | [HORSE]: has quickly dropped back down to his last winning mark on the back of some uninspiring efforts and shaped as if back in form, looking a big threat to the first 2 for a long way; chased leaders, travelled well, pushed along over 2f out, every chance 1f out, left behind by first 2 final 100 yds."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap run at an overly-strong gallop, whilst the field largely shunned the churned-up ground on the inner, the front pair both coming wide and late, the third doing well under the circumstances. | [HORSE]: confirmed return to form to gain a first success since his debut; in rear, good headway 2f out, kept on well, led final 50 yds, helped by being held up in a strongly-run race; the percentage call is that he's unlikely to follow up."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap in which the pace was a bit muddling, barely 2 lengths covering all 9 runners coming to the final 1f, the first 2 avoiding trouble and seen to better effect than they had been when in the same race at Southwell last time. | [HORSE]: below his best in four previous starts for this yard, performed much better and would have gone closer with a clear passage. Just 1lb higher than when winning over a furlong further here last October, he is one to watch out for."
"3rd of 15, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sprint handicap in which those drawn high dominated the frame, the in-form runner-up taking another step forward but finding just a well-treated veteran narrowly too good. | [HORSE]: came home strongly having been forced to change course when short of room inside the final furlong. He looks to be nearing a return to something like his best of a couple of a years ago."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap won by a progressive 3-y-o that was never too far from a modest pace, the veteran runner-up having the run of things for the most part, while the third and fourth were both better than the result from the rear. | [HORSE]: rarely runs a bad race at this track and duly returned to form despite not getting the race run to suit; held up, raced freely, headway under pressure 1f out, stayed on, would have benefited from a stronger gallop; sure to be of interest again around here."
"12th of 29, well beaten | [RACE]: With as many as 18 making their handicap debut this was unsurprisingly a deep contest, as it usually is, 7 of the first 10 doing so with the front pair taking their form to a smart level, the winner looking a group performer in an event that takes a little bit of explaining; they split into 2 groups with the 11 lowest drawn runners going far side, that contingent slightly ahead at halfway, though it was the stand-side group who came firmly to the fore, providing the first 7 home, with Magical Sunset best of the other side, the majority from that group either worth marking up or best excused the run, some also meeting trouble; the pace was a strong one with both sets of leaders going off too hard and it suited the closers, both Candle of Hope and Novus worth marking up considerably from those ridden prominently, winners bound to come from this. | [HORSE]: dropping in class and trip, was travelling well on the far side when she found herself badly hampered. She would have finished a fair bit closer and is one to keep an eye on, particularly as she's still unexposed on quick ground."
"Won | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap turned into a rout by one showing much improved form. | [HORSE]: , who wore a hood in combination with blinkers when second in a Brighton maiden on soft ground in September, proved a class apart from these rivals on just his second handicap start. Dropped 4lb since his last run, he was a little tardily away, but he moved stylishly into contention towards the near side in the straight and settle matters within a few strides. It appears Tapeta is very much his surface and connections will be keen to find him an opening under a penalty before his new inflated mark comes into play."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A strongly-run handicap very much set up for closers. | [HORSE]: had come back to some form when sixth in the Ayr Bronze Cup, two places behind this winner, and this is a run to mark up, best of those forwardly ridden. His best form is over 5f and he's handily weighted."
"6th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A couple weren't seen to best advantage, including the favourite, but they'd probably have only been playing for minor honours anyway, such was Yaaser's authority come the line. | [HORSE]: seeking a hat-trick for Daragh Bourke, didn't fail because of the switch to turf. He was left with little room in which to operate and would likely have went much closer on another day. He'll be one to bear in mind from what remains a workable mark."
"5th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A very messy low-grade contest, Twilight Kiss staying wide from her high draw until crossing over to lead before 5f out, all the closers coming through in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: broke well but was restrained at the back and got outpaced heading into the turn. He found them coming back to him in the straight, though, and made a strong bid down on the inside, before being run out of it inside the last."
"7th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: This should prove solid sprint handicap form amongst the principals, while several of those further back weren't seen to best effect, the start a particularly ragged one with Alligator Alley diving left and inconveniencing several of the runners. | [HORSE]: under a penalty, came here in search of a hat-trick but wasn't seen to best effect from a difficult draw, also not looking totally comfortable around the home turn; awkward leaving stalls, raced wide, in rear, ridden over 1f out, stayed on final 1f."
"3rd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A well-contested handicap and the form has a solid look to it, the first 2 well treated on old form, whilst the third boasts a reasonably positive profile. | [HORSE]: was a good bit sharper than on her return from a 76-day break at Hamilton last month and returned to the sort of form that had seen her win off a 2lb lower mark at Leicester in June. This was an encouraging first visit here, especially when noting she lost a front shoe."
"7th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A race confined to horses that hadn't won more than one race, though most of these hadn't troubled the judge at all and, what's more, the bare form looks rather muddling, the second and third closing in from a long way back off a strong pace set by a winner who deserves extra credit, those who'd given closest chase to him - including the hot favourite - all well beaten. | [HORSE]: was again a short price, somewhat surprisingly so given he's been failing to deliver for a while now. He has been a beaten favourite on his last four starts, 0-11 overall."
"7th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: An apprentice handicap in which they went hard with several disputing the lead throughout, the winner initially badly losing his spot but switching inside and finishing with a rattle to edge the bunched finish, a couple of riders losing their whips at crucial stages. | [HORSE]: shaped as if back in form, not getting much room to open up in the finish; held up, headway under pressure 1f out, short of room final 1f, kept on, not knocked about."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: What looked a competitive nursery was dominated by the first 2, though the form makes sense and looks solid enough. | [HORSE]: in a race in which the first three were prominent throughout, ran well to stay on from last and finish close up, and that despite having his momentum checked inside the final 2f. His novice win came in soft ground so a wet autumn should suit him very nicely."
"13th of 15, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful contest run at a decent tempo, the pace holding up as one on a handy mark made all with a pair of last-time-out winners filling the places. | [HORSE]: after just 8 days off from stable debut, is best not judged on this run having been left poorly placed from stall fifteen; raced wide early, held up, ridden over 2f out, made no impression."
"Won | [RACE]: A muddling contest in which the form is likely to prove unreliable, the ousider of the sextet opening her account on turf, the favourite yet to be asked for his effort when coming to grief in the straight. | [HORSE]: , a Chelmsford AW winner for Stuart Williams, enjoyed an uninterrupted passage down the inner and kept on to hold the late thrust of Hostelry. This was just her second start for Wilf Storey and, while she clearly stepped forward for her Newcastle run, it might be unwise to take this form at face value."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A strongly-run handicap won by a course specialist, the favourite arguably shaping best having got too far back after the blindfold had been removed late. | [HORSE]: continues in good heart; mid-field, went prominent early on final circuit, chased leader entering straight, went on over 1f out, edged out final 50 yds; it'd be wrong to suggest he's not effective at an easy 1½m, but at the same time he does shape as if always likely to be best with the emphasis on speed at it."
"11th of 20, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Plenty weren't seen to best effect with space at a premium once the 2 initial groups merged towards the centre of the track from halfway, while those who were kept more towards the stand side were seemingly at a disadvantage, the winner always travelling best in the optimal position front and centre. | [HORSE]: is best not judged on this run, 3 lb out of the handicap and ending up in a poor position; mid-division, outpaced 2f out, forced to switch over 1f out, kept on gradually last ½f, never dangerous."
"Won | [RACE]: This ought to prove an informative handicap, 4 well-bred, expensive fillies improving to pull clear in a pretty good time; the field were taken towards the far side by Stellenbosch and the finish was fought out by those that challenged on the far wing. | [HORSE]: was a Newcastle maiden winner first time out this year and added to that down in trip on her handicap debut. She showed a decent attitude but didn't have much in hand."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A one-sided contest with the class-dropping favourite blitzing them from the front. | [HORSE]: had the misfortune to run into a revitalised and well-handicapped sprinter for the second start in succession. His turn is near."
"3rd of 13, competitive | [RACE]: A useful 3-y-o sprint and form that looks strong, backed up by the time, 3 who filled the places over C&D at the Craven meeting again in the frame but no match for a handicap debutant who proved to be thrown in. | [HORSE]: had four of these rivals behind when winning a like-for-like race at the Craven meeting, including today's runner-up. She raced with only one other near the stands' side for much of the way, and this effort deserves marking up."
"8th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fair handicap that went the way of one of the top weights, who is putting together a good record since joining his current yard, that one coming a little way clear with a recent winner. | [HORSE]: in first-time hood, is better than he could show here, never getting a chance to open up; mid-field, ridden when hampered early in straight, no room over 1f out, finished with running left."
"6th of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: An interesting 3-y-o handicap but undoubtedly a muddling one on the day, no real pace on and a couple didn't get the best of runs, while those held up stood little chance. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, shaped better than the bare result; in rear, outpaced 2f out, kept on, nearest at the finish, would have benefited from a stronger gallop; remains with potential."
"Won | [RACE]: The poor showing of Ravenscraig Castle weakened this handicap to some extent, though it's hard to believe he'd have lived with Ahorsewithnoname even if he'd turned up at the top of his form, the mare drawing away from 2f out after the field had gone a solid gallop even whilst ignoring the runaway leader Inca Prince. | [HORSE]: progressed again as she defied a 6 lb rise for Newbury in much more emphatic fashion; mid-field, headway 4f out, produced to lead 2f out, quickened clear, in command entering final 1f, ridden out; she may be 7 but she's hardly had much racing for one of her age and the chances are she hasn't finished improving yet, all roads presumably leading to the Ascot Stakes now, but she will be appreciably higher in the weights there and it's a handicap the Irish have largely made their own in recent times."
"7th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Solid form for the level and a more even gallop than the first division, the winner doing it in good style from a pair who came into it in decent nick, the third not seen to best effect from a poor draw. | [HORSE]: well backed, is best excused this run, stumbling at the start and always caught wider than ideal; chased leaders on outer, ridden over 1f out, weakened final 1f."
"5th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A major injection of pace in the back straight soon thinned the field right out but left those responsible vulnerable in the straight, the winner grinding his way to the front late on, and the form has its limitations as a result. | [HORSE]: well backed in first-time blinkers, is probably better judged on the promise of his stable debut; led, quickened around 5f out, tackled 3f out, headed around 2f out, weakened 1f out, did too much too soon."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A lowly handicap which saw the favourite find enough to edge it on the line, the main principals in the betting coming to the fore. | [HORSE]: was the only one of these open to progress and duly saw out the 2f longer trip well on return from 8 months off, but winning around here under such patient tactics is always going to be tough; held up, pushed along 4f out, headway under pressure on inner final 1f, kept on, left with too much to do; remains with potential."
"8th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: Little to separate 3 of the three-year-olds through the latter stages of a lowly handicap in which several spoilt their chance by racing freely, there having been very little pace in the race until Miss Raincloud carted her way to the front after 2f. | [HORSE]: was too free retried beyond 1m; pulled way to front after 2f, headed around 3f out, hung right, lost place quickly, eased off with the bit having slipped through her mouth."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: This was run at an even stronger gallop to halfway than the first division, so it reflects well on the principals that they came home quicker, too, and this appeals as form likely to work out well, the winner completely unexposed, the second in top form and the pair that set the pace edging back down to good marks on form shown earlier in the year. | [HORSE]: has slipped in the weights and shaped well back in his usual piece of headgear for all he was unable to justify strong support; disputed lead, pushed along over 2f out, no extra final 100 yds, did too much too soon."
"Won | [RACE]: Not as strong a handicap as promised with plenty failing to handle the conditions, one that had the run of things clearing away late after a steady gallop saw plenty still hold chances 2f out. | [HORSE]: showed improved form to get off the mark upped in trip and in a change of headgear, benefiting from a change of tactics for all they looked to come about under duress, again not looking altogether straightforward for all he found plenty for pressure, possible he's just a slow learner; dictated, tackled 3f out, hung right and bumped rival entering final 1f, asserted final 100 yards, kept going well."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A wretched nursery sure to make for weak form, though at least there were reasons why the winner might've improved. | [HORSE]: again promised more than she delivered off the bridle, but this was still a step up."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A nursery that saw the first and second race at opposite ends of the field, the winner soon across to lead from his wide draw and his claimer getting the fractions spot on, the runner-up doing well to get so close from last. | [HORSE]: as at Newcastle last time, gave away valuable ground at the start and despite having another furlong to travel, that proved costly. She should have no problem winning races granted a better break."
"3rd of 19, involved in finish | [RACE]: A pair of outsiders filling the first 2 positions felt rather fitting considering the muddling nature of this year's Kensington Palace, as the complexion of a soundly-run race changed relay-style in the straight, the winner played last of the principals - and also widest of them - after others had trodden a similar path to get to the front briefly before she struck, any number on their inside not getting the gaps when needed as they returned very well clustered. | [HORSE]: , who matched the pick of her turf form when second on reappearance (AW), ran well back up in trip returned to turf in the first-time tongue-tie, despite running out of room at a crucial stage. She should make amends."
"16th of 29, well beaten | [RACE]: As is usually the case, this is a contender for the strongest handicap of the season, almost half of the field successful on their latest start and plenty arriving on the up as a result, the first 3 all doing so and improving again with Docklands and New Endeavour, who raced on opposite sides of the track, having this between them from 1f out and taking their form to a smart level; they split into 2 almost equal groups with stall 17 the dividing point, the far side seeming to hold the advantage, responsible for 7 of the first 10, the winner therefore worth marking up considerably having pulled well clear of the rest stand side, the hat-trick seeking runner-up from that group, Surely Not, also better than the result, as was the well-backed Quantum Impact who went all the way from the favoured side to the other when mounting his challenge, plenty from the latter pack having excuses; all in all this is a contest to follow for the coming months with the majority yet to take on their elders, and it will throw up plenty of winners. | [HORSE]: wasn't up to this better company after 6 weeks off, where he raced offering slight mitigation; dwelt, raced near side, mid-field, ridden over 3f out, headway when hung left under 2f out, no further impression."
"6th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: This threatened to be muddling until Zealot injected some pace at halfway, the well-backed top weight taking control in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: , hooded for his reappearance, was poorly positioned in a race not run to suit. He can do better next time."
"11th of 17, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful apprentice handicap and a fiercely competitive race of its type, the first 4 never too far away and all relatively prominent in the betting, while a couple drawn out wide had plenty on and were better than the result. | [HORSE]: , coming here on the back of wins at Ayr and Hamilton, ran into dead end after dead end. He's almost certainly still in form."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steady pace meant the prominently-ridden first 2 were much better positioned than the never-nearer third in this basement-grade staying handicap, none of the 3-y-os managing to make much of an impact. | [HORSE]: after 12 weeks off, shaped as if back in form dropped into a grade this low for the first time in a long time; dropped out, headway from 2f out, nearest at the finish, left with a lot to do and beaten only by a couple of much more prominently-ridden ones."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap on balance and solid form for the level, the winner building an excellent record on all-weather and edging out the game front runner. | [HORSE]: wasn't ideally drawn and raced three wide on the bend, but he was good enough to overcome that and secure a narrow victory. The form of his second to Helm Rock at Newcastle last time had been boosted by the winner going in again at Kempton off 8lb higher, and he proved well treated off only 1lb higher. The recent application of cheekpieces may have assisted him, but fundamentally he looks a better horse on synthetics."
"9th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fairly bunched finish to this low grade contest, though Better had dropped in the weights this year and was chased home by a fellow 3-y-o who is lightly raced on all-weather. | [HORSE]: under a penalty, rather predictably wasn't in the same form as when winning 8 days earlier; prominent, blindfold became stuck on rider's arm until halfway, weakened from over 1f out."
"9th of 16, well beaten | [RACE]: Plenty of evidence to go on - and not many frequent winners taking part - in an exposed field but the obvious exception to that still impressed in making such short work of them first time back, | [HORSE]: was given a considerate return from a 7-week break, back on turf for the first time since September; steadied at the start, dropped out, still plenty to do and left poorly placed over 2f out, brief headway soon after, no further impression, not unduly punished."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A second handicap on the card won by a short-priced favourite likely to be seen in pattern company sooner rather than later, the runner-up doing really well to make a race of it with him, the others unable to get in a blow in a soundly-run race; the field came over to the stand side in the straight. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, ran poorly, giving his rider no help at all; held up, refused to settle, dropped away under 3f out."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap that was blown apart by one of the 3-y-os, Contactless proving better than ever as he ran out a comfortable winner, the runner-up giving the form some substance even if few landed a blow from off the pace, Giant Steps catching the eye in third from a long way back. | [HORSE]: , down to a 0-55 for the first time, was always up there and looked to be travelling all over them turning in, but once in front she couldn't get clear. She is already due a 2lb rise."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A good event for the grade containing 4 last-time-out winners, including the handily-ridden Tyger Bay, who landed a quick-fire double, the next 4 home all coming from off the pace. | [HORSE]: ran well after 8 months off despite meeting trouble in running; held up, headway when not clear run from 2f out, got gap final 1f, ran on; she's eligible for lower-graded events, one to bear in mind with this under her belt."
"5th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Draw/tactics should never be underestimated here, but they proved paramount in this, Ever Given making the most of all the advantages, to the extent it's likely to prove flattering and a cautious view of the form is best taken rather than taking the view that the winner is a potential pattern performer all of a sudden. | [HORSE]: again wasn't seen to best effect and remains better judged on previous form; steadied at the start, dropped out, took strong hold, still plenty to do home turn, switched early in straight, late headway, had a hopeless task from position."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: Like the first division, a modest contest run at a steady pace, this perhaps even weaker, but it was notable for the riding performance of George Rooke who judged things to perfection on front-running Florence Street, the runner-up arguably the moral winner given how much ground he made up in the straight. | [HORSE]: was last seen in November 2020 and had been dropped 10lb in the meantime. This was a pleasing return for his new yard and there's obvious room in his current rating, although the bounce factor will need bearing in mind if he's turned out quickly."
"4th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap lacking progressive sorts, whilst it was run at an ordinary gallop as well, but it's a result that makes sense all the same, those in the frame either down to a good mark or arriving in form. | [HORSE]: is going through a good spell at the moment and would have given the winner most to think about had he got a clear run; mid-field, took strong hold, good headway under 2f out, denied a run before final 1f, forced to switch, kept on well final 100 yds, never nearer; he deserves credit for his consistency."
"Won | [RACE]: A useful fillies' handicap contested mainly by 3-y-os and it contained several relatively interesting types, plenty of whom finished in the first half of the field, but unsurprisingly for a big field around here it was a race where tactics and track position played a part, several meeting trouble towards the inner as the principals swept down the outer from off a strong gallop. | [HORSE]: , minus the cheekpieces she wore when struggling in the Sandringham at Royal Ascot, took her form to a new level. She looked to be on the best ground but the same goes for the next few finishers and it was striking how easily she made her way to the front."
"8th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap in which the early pace was contested, Street Kid doing best of those that raced up with it but reeled in late on by an unexposed 3-y-o. | [HORSE]: was strong in the betting but underperformed under an unusual ride, especially so considering it was Spencer on board; awkward leaving stalls, but rushed up out wide and led before halfway, headed over 2f out, weakened, ridden too aggressively; he's been consistent this year and is the type to bounce back quickly."
"4th of 19, involved in finish | [RACE]: As with last year's renewal, this was a race shaped very much by draw/track position, the action developing towards the far side, the front pair always up there from single-figure draws, while those drawn high had little chance given how it panned out, the run of the fourth encouraging in that regard, while the fifth also shaped well from a poor position in the centre. | [HORSE]: fared much the best of those drawn high despite having to forfeit ground making his way to the centre of the track. He has been in good heart lately and deserves plenty of credit for running so well in a race which didn't pan out favourably for him."
"Won | [RACE]: A typically ultra-competitive handicap, albeit one that lacked unexposed sorts this year, only a handful aged 5 or below, the winner being one of them as he cut down a well-weighted course specialist double his age who was ridden in contrasting fashion, the form likely to still prove solid, however; it unfolded middle-to-far side and those drawn high who raced towards the near wing were mainly at a disadvantage, Abate worth marking up as a result. | [HORSE]: capitalised on a falling mark (below last winning one) and looked rejuvenated by the refitting of blinkers, impressing with how much he found having not had the clearest of passages on ground that was probably as quick as he'd want it; dwelt, raced off the pace, met some trouble under 3f out, headway when denied a run 2f out, got gap over 1f out, led last ½f, well on top finish; the headgear now needs to have the desired effect again next time."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap that produced a blanket finish, the winner always well placed, the fourth and fifth better than the bare result further back. | [HORSE]: without the headgear after 5 months off, shaped better than the distance beaten suggests; held up, headway around 2f out, came wide soon after, kept on well final 1f, never nearer, left with too much to do; dropped the best part of a stone in the weights during a winless 2024 and looks one to consider, especially when faced with ground softer than good, also now eligible for lesser races than this."
"5th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: As expected with the prize money on offer this was a competitive event, and just like in the preceding Sprint Cup it was one who'd been purchased cheaply by current connections that obliged, Raasel running to a very high level for a handicap, admittedly with the race set up perfectly for him with the leaders having gone off so hard. | [HORSE]: was sucked into going off too hard in pursuit of Look Out Louis, soon a few lengths clear of the rest down the centre of the track, and paid the price late; led group, went with enthusiasm, led overall under 2f out, edged left, headed final 50 yds, went off too hard."
"5th of 6, competitive | [RACE]: The well-backed favourite may have finished last in this small-field event, but it still looks solid form, the finish contested by a trio of likeable types, the winner capable of following up. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect for the second start in succession, eligible for much lesser contests than this; held up, had to wait for gap under 3f out, effort when denied a run over 1f out, not recover."
"7th of 20, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A lack of unexposed sorts gave the form a solid rather than strong look, though it was a typically competitive affair, the well-in favourite giving it a bold go from the front and picked off only late on by a trio which included the gambled-on winner and a last-time-out scorer, though it was the third who would have collected with a clear run; the field elected to come towards the stand rail and a high draw wasn't a usual disadvantage as a result, the runner-up and fifth doing best of those on the other flank. | [HORSE]: is better than he was able to show back up in trip, meeting trouble on two separate occasions. He'll be of interest back at either Ripon or Newcastle, the scene of five of his six wins."
"6th of 10, competitive | [RACE]: This wasn't a deep race for the grade and although the 'right' horses came to the fore - the trio behind the winner all of some interest again - there's a chance that the dominant winner isn't quite so good as this performance makes him look, a relatively cautious view best taken of the form. | [HORSE]: stepped up on his reappearance without finding his best form, paying for early exuberance in the closing stages; held up, refused to settle, headway halfway, chased leaders 2f out, weakened final 1f."
"10th of 19, competitive | [RACE]: A valuable sprint handicap and strong-looking form, acknowledging the now-typical York draw bias was at play, those drawn high largely struggling to get involved and the efforts of Strike Red and Arctic Thunder worth marking up given their position on the near side. | [HORSE]: with cheekpieces reapplied, was having just his second start in a handicap and first outside of his age group but ran creditably, in front on the disadvantaged side of the track until his lack of recent racing perhaps told and giving himself a good platform to build from in sprint handicaps during the second half of the season; raced near side, in touch, headway 2f out, challenged approaching final 1f, not sustain effort."
"Won | [RACE]: Just a small field for this useful handicap, not a lot between the principals at the finish, the winner doing well to pick up having been stopped in his run over 1f out. | [HORSE]: back on turf (without the headgear this time), got back on the up after 5 months off, this not quite so big a surprise as his SP indicates, and he'd have been an unlucky loser given he met some trouble when launching his challenge, also overcoming his rider dropping the reins late on; in touch, travelled well, denied a run over 1f out, switched, stayed on to lead close home."
"4th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A soundly-run handicap, the leaders pressing on before the home turn and little to split 4 spread across the track at the line, one of the big outsiders just holding on. | [HORSE]: third less than 24 hours previously at Newcastle, was again 9lb well in following his earlier Chelmsford success, but he got caught further back than ideal and went right under pressure late on."
"6th of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: A poor turnout considering the money on offer and good placement of the winner who was always holding off the favourite, but the rest were below form and a cautious view of them pulling clear is advised; the field came down the middle of the track. | [HORSE]: ran poorly despite the return to conditions which should suit and her form is up and down; dwelt, mid-field, pushed along around halfway, left behind over 2f out."
"3rd of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A handicap that began in earnest when Jean Baptiste pressed on entering the straight, the winner taking a big step forward in first-time headgear, whilst the well-backed favourite shaped well from furthest back. | [HORSE]: a recent Pontefract winner (form franked), was strongest in the market, but didn't really have things go his way on this his first attempt over 1m2f. He kept on from a difficult position to take a never-nearer third. He's by Camelot, and his dam was a winner over this trip, so he deserves another chance."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: The main feature of this amateur jockeys' handicap was the strong pace, the 4 closest to the gallop all well beaten and the first 6 came well clear of the rest, the thriving second nailed on the line having led for most of the straight. | [HORSE]: ran a cracker to go very close to following up after 11 weeks off, travelling best but striking for home a shade earlier this time, also in a well-run race, and he was caught on the line; in touch, travelled strongly, led 2f out, ridden 1f out, headed post; will continue to give a good account."
"4th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: Slow-motion stuff and margins far more akin to a jumps race in mid-winter for the final race of a card run on rain-soaked ground, the winner relishing conditions while the majority of the others had the opposite experience. | [HORSE]: failed to repeat his Ffos Las effort, faced with even more testing conditions but also taken on for the lead this time; led 2f, remained prominent until 4f out, lost place quickly."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: An uncontested pace meant the emphasis was far more on speed than stamina in this useful staying handicap, the ready winner well placed to strike for home and having things sewn up entering the final 1f | [HORSE]: upped markedly in trip, ran well on first outing since leaving Henry Candy and is now with a yard that does well with similar types, plenty more options open to him now he's proved his stamina for staying distances; dropped out, steady headway 3f out, came wide straight, stayed on, took second close home, nowhere near as well positioned as the winner the way things panned out."
"Won | [RACE]: A bunched finish to a messy contest, the winner returning to form out of the blue and eventually getting a good run through, though several of the beaten horses either lacked room or found themsleves stumbling when trying to mount their challenges. | [HORSE]: a once capable juvenile, has been in freefall in the weights since returning from two years off the track but, dropping into a Class 5 for the first time, rediscovered a spark, threading the eye of a needle down the inner to cast his head in front where it mattered. It will be fascinating to see if he can retain this renewed vigour."
"4th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: A tale of 2 handicap debutants on pre-race ratings and the market, but it wasn't a fair fight, the completely-unexposed Poker Face spreadeagling his rivals in the straight, destined for much bigger things. | [HORSE]: got herself into a challenging position early in the straight but couldn't find any more, perhaps finding this coming soon enough on the back of her impressive maiden win here 2 weeks earlier, that remaining the only time she's tackled 1½m, too; held up, headway from 3f out, in touch under 2f out, not sustain effort."
"13th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: A race that should work out, the first 4 all with previous C&D victories to their name, Swinging Eddie doing well given he was up with the strong gallop throughout. | [HORSE]: can have this run overlooked, finding himself quickly detached after jinking violently right leaving the stalls."
"Won | [RACE]: A really ordinary handicap and it's hardly the most robust piece of form for the level, either, the pace very modest after the front runner had headed for the car park turning into the back straight. | [HORSE]: mastered rivals without jockey Paul Mulrennan asking a serious question and justified strong support in a messy race. She got lit up when the pace slackened on the back straight, but it was clear a furlong out she was the one to be on and this was deserved."
"8th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A well-run handicap won in good style by one that bounced back to form on just second outing for a new yard, Flatley getting no luck as he tried to close. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form under his penalty, not seen to best effect; in rear, pushed along 3f out, headway when badly hampered 1f out, not recover."
"4th of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap lacking depth, the form horse coming from off the pace to land the odds a shade cosily; the pace was fair. | [HORSE]: again ruined his chance with a very slow start and did well in the circumstances to stay on into fourth. He's capable of going in off this mark if getting away on level terms."
"6th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A very open affair on paper, reflected in the betting, but the race itself was anything but, Lord Melbourne quickly sealing matters when produced to rubbish any concerns about his absence. | [HORSE]: is clearly better than this, impeded over 1f out before short of room again final 1f and seeming to finish with running left, though in truth he didn't seem to be going anywhere when first meeting trouble, perhaps struggling to get to grips with the track."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful sprint that produced a clear-cut winner, though the favourite in second would have made it closer with anything like a trouble-free passage. | [HORSE]: was fitted with a visor for the first time and had to settle for minor honours once again after finding her path blocked through the penultimate furlong, the winner flown by the time she was in the clear; in touch, took keen hold, denied a run from 2f out, got gap inside final 1f, ran on, went 2nd dying strides."
"Won | [RACE]: The wide-margin winner raced very wide throughout and bagged the favoured stand-side rail in the straight and, with many of the others struggling to cope with conditions, this is surely form to treat with caution. | [HORSE]: , in a switch of headgear, took this race apart, a seventh career success. His wide stall proved a big advantage - he was surely on the best ground - and the veteran enjoyed being allowed to get on with it. Hopefully the handicapper won't take the form literally, although his last win in 2021 came off a mark of 69."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: All bar one were making their first start in this company and it proved a catalyst for improvement, the first 2 stepping up markedly. | [HORSE]: progressed a chunk switched to a nursery, beaten only by one who did the same, still rough around the edges; dwelt, held up, denied a run over 2f out, got gap under 2f out, headway when ran green entering final 1f, kept on."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A well-run race on soft ground provided the platform for well-handicapped sorts to assert their authority, none more so than a winner who's firmly on his way to pattern company. | [HORSE]: revelled in the mud last autumn and produced a career best back on soft ground for the first time this year, beating all bar a highly-progressive and pattern-bound 3-y-o; waited with, headway when hemmed in by winner around 2f out, chased leader last ½f, ran on; there's another decent autumn pot or 2 with his name on."
"Won | [RACE]: A useful performance from the remarkable winner who completed the 6-timer once more with plenty in hand. | [HORSE]: has proven an absolute sensation since switching to turf and there's no sign of a let up in her relentless progression, reverting to some quirks once in front but only pulling further clear as she hung over to the far rail to complete the 6-timer back down in trip, by no means fully extended and she's sure to merit respect wherever she turns up next; prominent, travelled well, led over 1f out, hung left final 1f, drew clear last ½f, had plenty in hand; thriving and will continue to be hard to rule out."
"10th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A bunched finish despite the field being strung out early with the leader racing clear, the majority of the principals reliable at this sort of level if not particularly well treated. | [HORSE]: just out of the handicap, can have a line put through this run; broke fast, raced clear, closed down halfway, headed over 2f out, weakened, did too much too soon."
"9th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly useful sprint which appeals as solid form despite it being weakened by the withdrawl of the 13/8 favourite He's An Angel on veterinary advice, the first 4 in the betting filling the frame, though the rest weren't beaten far. | [HORSE]: lost his chance at the start, with his rider slow to remove the blindfold."
"9th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A modest contest, the market leaders coming to the fore in a race run at an ordinary pace. | [HORSE]: on first outing since leaving Conor O'Dwyer after 15 months off, went with little promise in first-time tongue strap; reluctant start and flashed tail early, in rear, headway out wide halfway, driven 3f out, beaten over 1f out, eased off."
"5th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steady gallop meant this developed into a bit of a sprint, with a length and a half covering 7 of them at the line; nevertheless, the form still reads reasonably well despite a couple meeting trouble in the closing stages, Stellarmasterpiece notching a third C&D success. | [HORSE]: dropped back to this more suitable trip, went like the best horse at the weights, coming from a poor position in a steadily-run race and also denied a clear run; slowly into stride, in rear, headway 2f out, had running left in him but unable to fully open up final 1f as things got tight."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: The trio at the head of Timeform adjusted ratings - and the betting market - all bombed out in this handicap, pointing to weak form. | [HORSE]: tried to make all on this return to the Flat. He stayed on the inside in the home straight while the rest of the field came down the centre, and was only caught late on."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: An extremely messy finish, several getting bumped around, the winner causing plenty of trouble as he hung badly right, but probably just about the right result, the progressive 3-y-o Cock And Bull overcoming a poor start to edge it close home; the tempo was modest early on but upped around 4f out when Love Safari tried to lay it down to the leader. | [HORSE]: is down to a mark he can make an impact from nowadays and ran well to prove himself over 2f longer trip; mid-field, headway 2f out, challenged 1f out, bumped entering final 1f, led final 100 yds, headed near line."
"11th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap won by a gradually progressive 3-y-o that was always to the fore, but it proved an unsatisfactory contest with several having nowhere to go in the final couple of furlongs, a couple barely coming off the bridle. | [HORSE]: made some late ground to finish in the pack which wasn't bad considering how badly he missed the start with cheekpieces back on, but he certainly remains with plenty to prove; very slowly away, in rear, late headway."
"5th of 10, competitive | [RACE]: A strongly-run handicap which produced a busy finish with the field coming centre to near side, the winner still not fully exposed and asserting in good style in the final 100 yards. | [HORSE]: shaped as if in form, getting pestered for the lead from 3f out softening him up; led, challenged from 3f out, ridden when edged left over 1f out, headed, weakening when short of room final 100 yds, did too much too soon."
"6th of 18, competitive | [RACE]: A useful fillies' handicap contested mainly by 3-y-os and it contained several relatively interesting types, plenty of whom finished in the first half of the field, but unsurprisingly for a big field around here it was a race where tactics and track position played a part, several meeting trouble towards the inner as the principals swept down the outer from off a strong gallop. | [HORSE]: was a little more towards the far side in the closing stages than those who finished ahead of her. She'll need a stalls test before her next start."
"Won | [RACE]: A soundly-run handicap that has the look of very solid form for the grade, the betting dominated by three-year-olds, 2 of them coming clear having gone through the race in opposite fashion, the favourite managing to pull an unlikely-looking success out of the fire. | [HORSE]: followed up from last time, though had to work far harder this time, surely still very well handicapped to be able to pull this out of the fire, his cause looking a lost one under 3f out; patiently ridden, outpaced under 4f out, hung left from 3f out, headway over 1f out, found plenty to lead final strides; will be well suited by 1¾m, and probably even 2m before long, and is surely up to winning more races."
"Won | [RACE]: A sprint handicap blown apart by one who proved better than ever, a couple further back, including the returning favourite, shaping as if better for the run. | [HORSE]: was a pound well in after her recent C&D second. She had the best of the draw but had to wait for a run before quickly drawing clear in the final furlong. In this sort of form it would make sense to get her out quickly under a penalty."
"Won | [RACE]: The first 3 home appeal as interesting horses going forward in this kind of company, not least the well-bred winner. | [HORSE]: hadn't shown a great deal in a trio of qualifying runs but is out of a Prix de l'Opera winner and duly showed improved form to make a mockery of her opening BHA mark of 62, seeing the longer trip out well and now looking potentially well bought by her shrewd yard for 20,000 gns; never far away, raced freely, shaken up entering 2f out and led soon after, in control when eased near line; it would be a surprise if she didn't improve further still."
"8th of 16, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A handicap run at an overly-strong gallop, whilst the field largely shunned the churned-up ground on the inner, the front pair both coming wide and late, the third doing well under the circumstances. | [HORSE]: is better judged on previous form, a troubled passage meaning he was left with too much to do even allowing for how this unfolded; in rear, hampered over 1f out, had to pick way through final 1f, late headway."
"5th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A well-run sprint handicap that looks reasonable form for the grade, the rider on the winner judging things nicely, chased home by a pair of in-form sorts, while the fifth caught the eye by the finish. | [HORSE]: after 6 weeks off, not for the first time of late hinted at a revival, hardly getting the smoothest of passages and his rider not getting fully serious once more; broke on terms, raced well off the pace, shaken up 2f out, keeping on when forced to switch entering final 1f, hands-and-heels ride, nearest at the finish; down to good mark and one to note when the market speaks in his favour."
"Won | [RACE]: A heaped finish despite this being run at a better gallop than might hve been feared for a small-field sprint, the highly progressive Coul Angel quickening up best from off the pace and scoring a shade cosily. | [HORSE]: followed up from last time and is progressing well, winning 3 of his last 4 starts, all of those victories coming for this rider; held up, pushed along over 2f out, had to weave way through, led close home, edged right, had bit in hand; he's firmly in the groove at present and is sure to go well again, set for no more than a token rise in his mark given the distances involved here."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap more about quantity than quality, even for a class 6, and the run of the race played a part in the result, the winner enjoying a better passage through than the second and fourth. | [HORSE]: looked at least as good as ever as he opened his account, though he would certainly have been made to work harder had the runner-up enjoyed a clear run; dwelt, in rear, uncomfortable with pace, headway under pressure 2f out, switched soon after, stayed on to lead entering final 1f, driven out; he should be fully effective at 6f."
"2nd of 18, involved in finish | [RACE]: A well-contested handicap that tends to work out fairly well, and this looks no exception, a number of these looking of interest going forward; a sound gallop exposed any fitness chinks. | [HORSE]: had a good season last year, winning twice, and looked at least as good as ever returning at the age of 7 after 7 months off, in front before the winner in a soundly-run race having travelled best of all; in touch, loomed up 3f out, went on over 2f out, headed entering final 1f, edged left, kept on."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Yantarni looked to have plenty in his favour, but a horribly messy race didn't show him to advantage, the winner getting first run and looking a bit more straightforward, the first 2 pulling away from the bunch only very late on, several of the hard-to-fancy runners that appear to have run okay, perhaps somewhat flattered; the field raced as 2 groups in the centre, not much of an advantage either way in the way the race was run. | [HORSE]: couldn't follow up his comeback soft-ground win on the other course here, up 5lb, but this was still another useful run and he can probably progress some more."
"2nd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: A falsely-run handicap which favoured those ridden prominently, the first 3 occupying those positions throughout and the patiently-ridden favourite not seen to best advantage in fourth. | [HORSE]: who sat just off the winner, had every chance to go by in the straight but was outbattled. He did lack a recent run, however (only one in the field making his reappearance), and might come on for it. He's on a mark he can win off judged on last season's best."
"4th of 17, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A well-run handicap that suited those ridden with more patience, low numbers an advantage, too, the first 2 home drawn nearest to the far rail. | [HORSE]: shaped as if good heart after 12 weeks off, done no favours by the draw and forced to come widest of all in the straight, passing plenty; steadied at the start, dropped out, headway 2f out, kept on."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A weaker handicap than looked likely beforehand with most of those restrained in the second half of the field pulling their chance away, the second in particular and fourth doing well under the circumstances with the first and third ridden with greater efficiency on the day, the form overall untrustworthy as a result. | [HORSE]: might have found one too good but pretty much confirmed the promise of his run in the Britannia and has this as a platform on which he can build; mid-field, raced freely, pushed along 2f out, headway over 1f out, stayed on; though he was keen, his finishing effort suggests a return to 1m at some stage shouldn't be off the table."
"4th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: The emphasis was more on stamina than speed in this sprint handicap, the first 2 both likely to be just as effective over further and that proved the undoing of the favourite after he'd gone from the front with typical zest, the bare form not necessarily an accurate reflection. | [HORSE]: is better judged on previous form given she wasn't seen to best effect here; held up, forced to switch 2f out, one paced, not persevered with once held."
"Won | [RACE]: A straightforward race to assess, the first 2 both last-time-out winning 3-y-os, one considerably more progressive than the other, little to recommend those outside of the placings. | [HORSE]: completed a rapid hat-trick with at least as much in hand, breezing into it from the rear despite having to challenge wider and from further back than ideal, looking sure to rack up even more wins if holding her form during this busy spell; held up, travelled well, good headway out wide home turn, led final 1f, drew clear, had plenty in hand; holds plenty of entries and will remain of serious interest."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap with the joint-favourites fighting it out, The Turpinator having plenty of form at a higher level and holding off a more lightly-raced maiden having been allowed first run. | [HORSE]: found only one too good, but again ran well and is threatening to come good soon, in front too soon last time which perhaps contributed to him being left with a bit too much to do on this occasion; mid-field, shaken up 2f out, driven entering final 1f, ran on, conceded first run."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary, open-looking nursery, in which ability to handle the testing conditions was paramount, few of these having run on even soft ground previously; the action developed well towards the stand rail, with a position close to it seeming an advantage. | [HORSE]: had the highest draw and raced against the stands' rail which can often be the place to be at Haydock at this time of year. He was delivered to win his race but got tired in the last few strides and couldn't see it through. He is 0-9 but may be able to win something similar when the mud is flying."
"7th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: Form to treat with caution given the slow gallop, the first 4 finishing in a heap with just 3 short heads separating them, the order likely to be different another time, Prairie Falcon arguably shaping best given the came from further back than the other 3. | [HORSE]: without headgear, was given a considerate return from a 5-week break on his debut for new stable (left Laura Mongan 6,000 gns last month); led, took strong hold, headed under 2f out, weakened, not knocked about; he's lurking on a good mark these days and isn't one to write off."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A handicap which saw a useful performance by the oldest runner in the field, Qaasid coming down the outer to resume ways decisively back down in grade, neither the second or third getting the best of runs towards the inside. | [HORSE]: didn't take well to headgear and quickly got back on track going without, proving himself on firmer ground in the process and his mark is below the one that saw him shape well on reappearance so there's still races to be won with him this year; held up, headway when no room 2f out, switched 1f out, kept on, clear of remainder; one to be interested in."
"4th of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: A lowly 3-y-o handicap, a couple disappointing and the winning favourite suited by the emphasis on speed. | [HORSE]: has probably got more ability than she's been able to show to date, but the suspicion is she isn't straightforward so she's not one for maximum faith as it stands; prominent, raced freely, challenged 2f out, hung right over 1f out, carried head awkwardly, no extra last ½f."
"4th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A large field for a higher-grade sprint handicap, several of these having contested pattern or listed company, the winner last seen in the Middle Park, fitness potentially an issue that might have made the race less competitive, with 10 of the 14 having their first run of the year, though seemingly it turned out not to be a concern for the first 2; the field raced as one group down the centre, the pace a good one, the first 3 coming from off the pace, the winner right from the back of the field, some of those more at the sharp end perhaps better than the result. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, after 7 months off, shaped very well, ridden much more prominently than the trio that beat her, plenty to like about the way she went about things with similar races in mind; handy, travelled well, shaken up under 2f out, led briefly 1f out, kept on; remains capable of better and one to be interested in again."
"5th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: Plenty of runners but only a middling handicap for the track, most fully exposed and well treated ones thin on the ground, an improving 4-y-o filly being the exception; the race seemed set up to bring the best out of those that were patiently ridden. | [HORSE]: was in a deeper race than he's been contesting and is holding his form well, maybe a bit better than the result in doing best of those ridden close up, too; prominent, every chance from 3f out, no extra entering final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: Although no fewer than 10 of the 14 runners were having their first outing of the year, this still looked a highly competitive race of its type and it should throw up a winner or 2; it was strongly run, with the field well strung out in the back straight, but things became messy early in the home straight, quite a few finding trouble, the winner and third among them, the majority of the principals coming from off the pace, the fourth doing particularly well in the circumstances. | [HORSE]: strong in the betting and with a good record here, looked in fine shape after 6 months off and bounced back to his best, picking up well after his rider had to wait until the cutaway to find room, though the race was run ideally for him pace-wise; held up, tanked along, had to wait for gap early in straight, headway 2f out, led well inside final 1f, kept on, ridden out."
"5th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: Reasonable-looking form for the grade with one imporving for a change of stable making her challenge latest of all to see off an unexposed type and one in top form; a fair gallop lifted far enough out to make this a good test. | [HORSE]: had the race run to suit but got outpaced early on the home bend and, left with too much ground to make up, wasn't hard ridden in the straight. Despite that, he still stayed on well, and at some point he's likely to take advantage of his declining mark."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: Just the sort of handicap that suffers from its proximity to the Ebor meeting, though it was competitive enough in the circumstances, the winner taking a step forward under a change of tactics but seem to maximum effect with the second unfortunate not to run her down; the field came towards the stand side. | [HORSE]: wasted no time getting back to form, ridden in contrasting fashion to the winner, and unlucky not to win; steadied at the start, in rear, travelled well, effort under 2f out, good headway entering final 1f, took second last ½f, kept on well, just failed; he's going the right way now for current stable and can gain compensation before long."
"5th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: The track's feature race of the season attracted a competitive field, though a lack of 4-y-os and unexposed sorts means that it is probably just ordinary form in the context of good-quality handicaps around this trip, a bunched finish also giving reason not to rate the form too highly. | [HORSE]: , a useful four-time winner in France (all on good to soft), could prove a shrewd buy at 37,000euros after this promising first run for a new yard which does so well with new recruits, improving into a challenging position before his six-month absence began to tell late on. He'll be one to bear in mind next time."
"5th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A well-contested 3-y-o handicap that looks sure to produce improvers, the winner justifying favouritism in smooth style and several further back shaping with promise; the pace was sound and the first 3 were all waited with to a degree. | [HORSE]: a big eyecatcher on his nursery debut last autumn but not so good twice after, shaped encouragingly under a 7-lb claimer considering he lacked a recent run (off 6 months) and was running in a much better race than necessary, holding his own with useful rivals for a long way; helped force pace, outpaced 2f out, plugged on; it's easy to see him taking a lot of beating in a 0-65 or 0-70."
"4th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: Fitzrovia was subsequently demoted | [HORSE]: came here in good form and is best excused this run; led, raced freely, saddle slipped after 1f, headed over 1f out, weakened."
"8th of 22, involved in finish | [RACE]: As fiercely a competitive handicap as the numbers suggested, the main action happening more towards the near side in the finish and Pressure's On was always in a good spot just behind the pace, a whole host of closers in behind him shaping well given troubled passages, not least his fellow dead-heater, Quest For Fun, who looked unlucky not get the outright success. | [HORSE]: ran creditably from a mark that's on the lenient side granted better luck than he got here; mid-field, headway when short of room and hampered over 1f out, ran on; will remain of interest."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A pair who'd been beaten only by progressive 3-y-os on their latest start headed the betting and they filled the places behind a handicap debutant from the same age group, but that doesn't tell the full tale, Dashing Panther shaping best at the weights and would have undoubtedly collected but for throwing it away late in the day, those in the frame clear of some uninteresting sorts. | [HORSE]: who'd bumped into a progressive 3-y-o when last seen 9 weeks earlier, found only one too good for the third start in a row down in grade but should have won; dwelt, raced wide/freely, mid-field, hung right soon after start, headway to lead 5f out, at least lengths clear driven entering straight, in command approaching final 1f, hung badly right soon after, headed close home; still relatively unexposed and although his sole win came when going this way around, he's likely to be suited by a return to a right-handed track on this evidence."
"3rd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: The front runner went off way too hard but others were caught out of their ground, and the winner - who was prominent in the main group - was in no danger once taking the lead in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: is a dual C&D winner who did far too much too soon but still clung on for third. He should remain competitive if he can distribute his energy more favourably."
"6th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A handicap that went the way of one who has recently been reinvented as a stayer, Rock Chant's turn of foot proving decisive, not many in behind ever really threatening. | [HORSE]: got rushed up to lead after a tardy start and fell in a hole when headed turning in, with the run surely coming too soon."
"4th of 25, involved in finish | [RACE]: A typical Wokingham in many ways, needing a smart performance from Unequal Love to come out on top, the fifth filly or mare to win the race this century, but the first since Interception in 2015; whether this form proves quite so strong as usual is debatable, as though the field initially raced in 2 groups, they both raced towards the centre and converged around halfway, space at a premium and several not seen to best effect, the first 6 able to pull a little way but in a heap in behind. | [HORSE]: has been sharpened up by the refitting of headgear and ran at least as well in defeat as when winning at Newbury, anchored by the 6 lb rise, though without which he wouldn't have made the cut; chased leader, went on before halfway, headed entering final 1f, kept on."
"7th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The draw typically played a part in deciding a sprint handicap in which a couple of those not so well drawn as the winner on the day will likely make more appeal next time; the leaders overdid things, the front 3 coming from the second or third waves. | [HORSE]: better than the bare facts of his last run at this venue, was well supported from his low draw but was taken on in front and didn't get home. He'll be of more interest when it looks as though he'll be able to dominate."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful 3yo handicap, Enpassant doing enough to hold off handicap newcomer Moon Man. | [HORSE]: who has been tricky in the past to say the least, got it right this time having travelled well as he usually does, though he may have found himself in front earlier than ideal and didn't do a great deal once there. This was his first win (disqualified once) but wouldn't be a good thing to follow up."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A messy contest that resulted in a bunched finish and it's form best treated with caution. | [HORSE]: emerges with credit having been stuck wide throughout after coming out of stall 12. He's fairly treated and could win again soon."
"6th of 17, competitive | [RACE]: A typically competitive York handicap with several holding chances as they approached the final 1f, the winner putting up a smart effort under his big weight but plenty were not seen to best effect on the day, the pace no more than fair and a few of the more interesting types failing to get a clear run at things, the first pair themselves meeting trouble. | [HORSE]: in first-time cheekpieces, is holding his form well this season, probably doing well under the circumstances here too having been stuck on the outside in a deeper race, though it did at least mean he avoided the trouble of others, actually causing a fair bit of it, in truth; raced wide, mid-division, headway over 3f out, ridden when edged left from 2f out, every chance 1f out, weakened final 100 yds."
"5th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap in which the favourite was always well placed and got off the mark in comfortable fashion. | [HORSE]: , not yet exposed, would have had much more of a say had he not completely messed up the start."
"3rd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: Although no fewer than 10 of the 14 runners were having their first outing of the year, this still looked a highly competitive race of its type and it should throw up a winner or 2; it was strongly run, with the field well strung out in the back straight, but things became messy early in the home straight, quite a few finding trouble, the winner and third among them, the majority of the principals coming from off the pace, the fourth doing particularly well in the circumstances. | [HORSE]: ran a cracker on stable/seasonal debut under joint top-weight, having disappointed on his last two starts for Sir Michael Stoute. He stays further and is ground-versatile so could pick up a nice prize if building upon this."
"5th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap that produced a blanket finish, the winner always well placed, the fourth and fifth better than the bare result further back. | [HORSE]: back on turf and in a better grade of race than he normally contests, was unlucky not to finish closer; mid-field, headway under pressure over 1f out, around a length down and keeping on well when no room final 50 yds, sure to have been right in the mix for the places granted more luck."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: The unexposed favourite proved to be a let down in this fairly useful event, but a well-backed pair came to the fore, the 3-y-o winner taking a step forward, whilst the third would have finished closer if getting the breaks, so this looks reasonable form for the level. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden, attracted support and did enough to show he remains in good form under a change of tactics, but not for the first time left the impresion he wasn't giving it 100% at the business end; held up, smooth progress over 2f out, led under pressure over 1f out, headed when hung right last ½f."
"Won | [RACE]: An uncompetitive 3-y-o handicap, especially with Hadley Park again let down by his attitude, the door left open for Demilion, though he is worth crediting with some progression given the ease of victory. | [HORSE]: making handicap debut, showed improved form to get off the mark, justifying market confidence in the process; chased leader, travelled fluently, ran green/carried head bit awkwardly straight but quickened to lead final 1f, won readily; margin of victory was helped by his main rival wilting late on, but he'll go on improving and remain of interest."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: Most simply couldn't cope with such a stern examinaiton provided by a strong gallop on heavy ground, the first 3 all having spent much of the race towards the inside rail, though Tele Red's jockey wisely angled into the clear in plenty of time, allowing him to take command of the race when Lightening Company was stuck for room, those 2 the oldest pair in the race and all in all a conservative view of the form surely best. | [HORSE]: soundly beaten on AW on his previous start, fared a good deal better, especially as he was denied room. He's a winning hurdler who will be worth another chance."
"6th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: A large field for a higher-grade sprint handicap, several of these having contested pattern or listed company, the winner last seen in the Middle Park, fitness potentially an issue that might have made the race less competitive, with 10 of the 14 having their first run of the year, though seemingly it turned out not to be a concern for the first 2; the field raced as one group down the centre, the pace a good one, the first 3 coming from off the pace, the winner right from the back of the field, some of those more at the sharp end perhaps better than the result. | [HORSE]: was popular in the market on handicap debut back on grass but again raced with the choke out and didn't get home in a race that was set up for the closers. He'll be worth another chance."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap which developed along familiar lines for one over this C&D, the field congregating towards the far side with the low-drawn horses favoured, Boardman in fourth doing well in that regard, whilst Il Bandito impressed with how he travelled for a long way under an aggressive ride in a strongly-run race. | [HORSE]: back from a spin over hurdles, was kept right against the far rail and showed a most determined attitude when brought to challenge and just prevail in a driving finish. He clearly relishes soft ground and remains unexposed, so there is probably more to come."
"2nd of 6, competitive | [RACE]: A basement-level handicap that proved very one-sided after an early scramble for the lead that ensured a strong gallop. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form, unlucky to bump into one for one thing but also meeting some trouble, either way able to uphold recent superiority over the favourite despite worse terms; in touch, effort home turn, not clear run briefly straight, got gap final 1f, kept on, no impression on winner."
"2nd of 8 | [RACE]: Monsieur Lambrays was subsequently demoted | [HORSE]: lost the race in the Stewards' room but this was at least a big step up on his two previous efforts for this stable. It could be argued that HALIPHON edging right played a part in the initial interference between the pair but he continued to lean on his rival with Orr, who was banned for a total of six days for two separate offences, using his whip in his incorrect hand so the Stewards were left with little choice."
"Won | [RACE]: The majority were 4-y-os and one making his handicap debut prevailed in a tight finish to a race which unfolded only approaching 2f out, a couple of the closers worth marking up as a result, chiefly the unlucky runner-up. | [HORSE]: whose stable is going well, had Buick on board for the first time, as well as being less exposed than the rest and took a further step forward to make a successful handicap debut, having the run of things but still having to battle well to get back past the third, though he wouldn't have collected had Chalk Mountain got a clear shot at things; dictated, kicked on over 2f out, headed entering final 1f, rallied, led again last ½f, just held on."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modestly-run contest but that didn't stop the hold-up horses getting involved, the well-backed winner quickening decisively to lead entering the final 1f, though the runner-up would likely have given him plenty to think about with a clearer run. | [HORSE]: has never been lower in the weights and shouldn't be long in winning in this grade, charging home once in the clear, looking unlucky not to win; dived left leaving stalls, held up, travelled well, headway when no room over 1f out, switched final 1f, finished well."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: Form to view positively for the level, which is no rarity in the Sunday Series, the 3 who pulled clear all successful at least once in recent starts. | [HORSE]: ran at least as well in defeat as when winning the time before, again making testing ground look like good to firm; chased leader, travelled best, led before end of back straight, ridden when edged left over 1f out, headed approaching final 100 yds, no extra close home; there'll be lesser handicaps and smaller fields he can dominate in the coming weeks, a 4 lb rise for Chester evidently not harsh."
"11th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: The feature of ths low-grade handicap was the strong pace, the race set up for the closers, things unfolding ideally for Concert Boy under a well-judged ride, but there's no doubting that the one to take from the race is the pace forcer Goldmoyne, holding on to third despite the rest of the prominent racers finishing out the back and it's surely just a matter of time before he's winning races for his new yard. | [HORSE]: failed to repeat last effort having raced closer to the pace than ideal; dwelt, chased leaders, effort 2f out, weakened over 1f out."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: This is handicap form with a very solid look to it, plenty of in-form sorts in the top half of the field, their efforts backed up by the timefigure. | [HORSE]: whose stable won this contest a year ago, ran his best race for a while despite making a big move before halfway."
"6th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap with little separating the first 3, all of them having raced towards the fore in a race which saw nothing held up land a telling blow. | [HORSE]: is down to a good mark and stepped up on recent run, shaping better than the bare result; poorly drawn, steadied at the start, in rear, raced freely, headway 1f out, kept on for hand riding, nearest at the finish; one to keep an eye on."
"Won | [RACE]: A fair fillies' handicap run at a sound gallop, and a couple of 3-y-os at the head of the market finished first and third; the field split into 2 groups early but had merged by halfway and the finish developed against the far rail. | [HORSE]: up in distance for her handicap debut, had been mainly 7-1 the night before. In the pack who stayed more centre for a while early, which appeared a positive, she displayed a fine attitude on the softening ground to get off the mark. There should be more to come."
"3rd of 16, competitive | [RACE]: A competitive handicap on paper, though it proved anything but in truth, the winner turning it into a procession in the final 1f, Badri defying a high draw to sweep down the outside and quickly settle matters once hitting the front. | [HORSE]: a half-length second to today's winner at Newcastle last time, didn't get a clear run against the inside rail and had to be switched. He looked unlucky not to finish second but like the rest he had no chance with the winner."
"Won | [RACE]: A desperately weak race, Bradman having no trouble landing the odds back off his correct mark. | [HORSE]: strongly supported, had run well from out of the weights the previous week and, back off his correct mark, took full advantage to register an easy first success. Already due to be raised 6lb, that revision could underestimate him."
"10th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A solid handicap for the grade which saw the thriving winner pounce late to edge out the well-treated runner-up. | [HORSE]: can have a line put through this run; poorly drawn, raced very wide, in touch, raced freely, beaten over 1f out, left poorly placed."
"Won | [RACE]: A race for apprentices that had not ridden more than 10 winners, and there was major misjudgement from 4 of them, firstly in allowing the winner to build up such an advantage without having to work hard and then in not responding early enough when it was apparent the gap was uncomfortably big, resulting in 10-day bans for the 4 beaten riders; the winning time was really slow, and clearly a very cautious view of the winner's performance is needed. | [HORSE]: a hitherto 15-race maiden, was effectively presented with the race given the pace misjudgement of the other inexperienced apprentices; slowly into stride, not settle fully, led after 1f, allowed to drew well clear gradually with little effort, clearly in command over 3f out, completely unchallenged; needless to say, this was nothing like the step forward it might appear, and she's surely one to oppose next time from a higher mark."
"8th of 19, competitive | [RACE]: A big field assembled for this useful contest, though few hold any secrets from the handicapper, the stable-switching winner a notable exception, taking a step forward in what looks a good time; the 4 runners drawn highest raced in a group early before merging with the rest of the field and it was a level playing field. | [HORSE]: easy to back, proved he retains all his ability after 11 months off; waited with, driven halfway, still plenty to do under 2f out, plugged on, nearest at the finish; it's likely he'll tighten up for this and it bears repeating that he'll stay 1m."
"3rd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: A field size and betting market akin to a BAGS race and a quality of form much nearer A10 grade than A1. | [HORSE]: back in trip, wasn't disgraced after helping to force an ordinary gallop. She stays this trip but all her wins have been over shorter."
"Won | [RACE]: A messy handicap worth treating with some caution, a couple out of the race early on and the favourite always up against it from the rear in a steadily-run contest. | [HORSE]: got back on track with hood back on, but still raced as freely as ever, an easy time of things up front allowing him to keep on well enough to edge it towards the near rail; soon led, raced freely, pushed along 2f out, hung left, kept on, had the run of the race."
"Won | [RACE]: The odds-on favourite was sluggish at the start but tanked his way into contention in a soundly-run race and soon had matters in hand. | [HORSE]: unpenalised for last week's success, totally blew the start but still completed the hat-trick with ease, a well-run race suiting him very well, the yard going better now than for some time; in rear, headway on bridle under 3f out, switched soon after, produced to lead under 2f out, quickened clear final 1f; will be much higher in the weights when next seen but he's clearly thriving since joining current yard."
"7th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: They split into 2 groups in this fairly useful event, stalls 1-6 racing down the centre with the remainder towards the stand rail and it was dominated by the former contingent, Buraback in fifth faring best of those who came near side. | [HORSE]: shaped better than the distance beaten suggests, second home in his group; raced stand side, in touch, ridden 2f out, faded."
"Won | [RACE]: Plenty to like about the winning favourite who took a very wide route to success from the rear, eventually wearing down one reappearing in top form with something to spare. | [HORSE]: avoided a penalty for her 5l Southwell win three days earlier so was 8lb well in. Although she had to work harder this time, she overcame being held up last off a steady gallop and racing wide on the home bend as the pace was quickening. Her new mark won't be beyond her."
"8th of 21, competitive | [RACE]: A fairly useful sprint in which they split into 2 groups, stalls 1-8 racing middle-to-far side but it was the bigger group and those drawn higher that held sway over C&D for a change, recent winner Tiriac just edging out one who had gone close in a similarly big field at Ascot the time before; the pace was a strong one, some quirky types that made some late inroads best not given too much credit. | [HORSE]: caught the eye again, keeping on from an unpromising position."
"5th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap but it proved muddling, the free-going Sun Power ignored out in front and it made for a messy finish, the winner much better placed than the second. | [HORSE]: ran respectably on the back of a 4 lb rise in the weights, not seen to best effect; dwelt, held up, headway over 1f out, switched inside final 1f, one paced, would have benefited from a stronger gallop."
"9th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A useful handicap, though not a particularly strong one, nor one run at a flat-out gallop, the race developing in the final 2f, the field again up the centre. | [HORSE]: shaped as if needing the run on first outing since leaving Clive Cox for 100,000 gns, in first-time tongue strap after 10 months off, too free in front for his own good; soon led, pulled hard, shaken up over 2f out, headed soon after, weakened over 1f out; he looked the sort to go on again at 4 yrs, his next run likely to give a better indication of whether that will be the case."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap that saw the pair of 4-y-os at the head of the market duly fill the first 2 places, and they're both worth extra credit over the rest, the winner gearing down late on and the runner-up meeting trouble in running, both sure to remain of interest. | [HORSE]: confirmed promise of C&D second last month with his rider keeping things simple from a potentially problematic draw; got across from stall 12 and soon led, travelled smoothly, shaken up over 1f out, quickened around 3 lengths clear and merely kept up to work under hands-and-heels ride, closed down once the race was over as a contest and value around double the bare margin; will continue to give a good account."
"5th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Solid form for the grade, the first 2 in good order and both getting past one that is down to a handy mark now. | [HORSE]: is one to be very interested in, the handicapper having cut him plenty of slack despite all 3 runs this year being over a wholly inadequate trip, also not by any means given a hard time by his claimer here, making ground up rapidly in the final 1f to serve warning that he's ready to strike under more suitable circumstances; steadied at the start, adrift in rear, ridden tenderly home turn, ran on, not unduly punished, nearest at the finish, found the test inadequate; will be suited by a return to 7f+; one to look out for."
"6th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that produced a tight finish, the winner getting clear sailing along the stand-side rail, while a couple of the beaten horses didn't get the best of runs, including the third, who looked an unlucky loser. | [HORSE]: would have been involved in the finish but for running into a wall of horses inside the last. He was a bit unlucky the time before also and looks on a competitive mark."
"4th of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A couple that had been shaping up well sandwiched a last-time-out winner, but this was run at a stop-start gallop and certainly doesn't look like form to be getting carried away with at all. | [HORSE]: who had run poorly over jumps when last seen, returned to form without really getting the rub of the green; held up, not settle fully, headway on stand rail under 2f out, met some trouble soon after, plugged on, short of room again final 100 yds; one to bear in mind again now."
"9th of 17, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A race with a well-earned reputation as one of the strongest 3-y-o handicaps in the calendar, Quinault getting the better of subsequent pattern winners Washington Heights and Mill Stream in last year's renewal, but this year's race comes with a couple of caveats, heavily influenced by draw and pace, the winner ideally positioned to pick up the pieces, but value for a smart effort all the same under his big weight as he swept through from last, the placed pair and Tropical Island who seemed to need to run likely to be of more immediate interest. | [HORSE]: paid the price for setting too strong a gallop, dropping out tamely once headed."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A standard race for the grade, Abnaa responding well to a change of headgear and pinching an insurmountable lead once going on over 3f out, the runner-up doing well to get as close as he did and the one to take from the race. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden, went like the best at the weights back down in trip on a track that suits her well, conceding first run to the winner and only narrowly failing to make up the leeway; held up, travelled smoothly, pushed along 2f out, headway 1f out, edged left, stayed on, nearest at the finish; one to be interested in."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade sprint taken by the well-backed favourite, a couple of big-priced 4-y-os chasing him home from much further back. | [HORSE]: returning from a two-month break after disappointing at Nottingham, wasn't in the ideal position - in rear and caught wide - but finished off purposively down the centre, catching the eye in third. He's on a fair mark, so could easily gain amends."
"8th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A modestly-run handicap, the winner worth affording extra credit over the result having overhauled a much less exposed rival who had the run of things, a few further back not seen to best effect given how the way the race panned out. | [HORSE]: would have wanted a considerably stronger gallop, while he met with a bit of trouble too. He's only 1-20 on the Flat, and not one to be making excuses for, but he's up to winning from this sort of mark when things fall his way."
"6th of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: A messy race run at a slow gallop in which the runner-up shaped best but found the post coming too soon. | [HORSE]: again wasn’t beaten far despite finishing last but ruined his chance by racing far too freely; handy, refused to settle, pulled way to front briefly end of back straight, headed soon after, remained prominent, no extra inside final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: A messy nursery in which the much-improved winner caused a big shock, Andalseeyagraham getting clear sailing down the outside while several of his rivals ended up stuck in traffic on the near-side rail. | [HORSE]: back down in distance and with the visor discarded, came with a strong run round the outside of the pack from off the pace and actually won pretty comfortably. It was a surprise to see him win from out of the handicap, but he did cost 62,000euros and is a half-brother to four winners including Group 2 winner Sir Busker, and this didn't look a fluke."
"16th of 18, well beaten | [RACE]: A useful handicap that was strongly run thanks to Bowman, setting things up for those in the second half of the field, things panning out ideally for Lyndon B who got a charmed run up the inner at the cutaway, getting first run on the second who might well have won had he got an uninterrupted passage. | [HORSE]: found run of good form coming to a halt, not the first time he's run poorly at this course, though he has handled the undulations of Chepstow; mid-field, struggling before halfway, lost place 2f out."
"10th of 16, well beaten | [RACE]: A handicap which developed along familiar lines for one over this C&D, the field congregating towards the far side with the low-drawn horses favoured, Boardman in fourth doing well in that regard, whilst Il Bandito impressed with how he travelled for a long way under an aggressive ride in a strongly-run race. | [HORSE]: probably needed the run after 5 months off; slowly into stride, in rear, ridden when met some trouble over 2f out, not knocked about, never a threat; wins-to-runs ratio leaves something to be desired but he's down to a potentially lenient mark and should be closer to form next time."
"4th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: A steady pace, set by the runner-up, meant the short-priced favourite had to work a bit harder than the market anticipated to prevail, the pair clear of a couple stepping up in trip, the fourth given very little chance to show what he could do, the way the race was run. | [HORSE]: was given an exaggerated waiting ride, presumably with doubts about his staying the 1f longer trip, but that meant he had very little chance the way the race was run, even if he did stay, clearly better than the result; in rear, travelled well, shaken up over 1f out, ran on, never on terms, left with too much to do; not obviously well treated, but definitely better than this suggests."
"Won | [RACE]: A fillies' handicap blown apart by a handicap/all-weather debutant, Vibrant Pearl effortlessly coming from last to first and scoring with plenty more in hand than the bare margin implies, another unexposed 3-y-o chasing her home. | [HORSE]: switching to the AW on her handicap debut, made her ground up easily on the wing and won with more in hand than the margin suggests, not needing a hard ride to assert and eased up near the line. She looks one with a good deal more to offer, especially on artificial surfaces."
"10th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A positive addition to the card, the race upgraded from class 3 status in 2023 and worth more than double to the winner this time, and it attracted a smart field, Lethal Levi perked up by new headgear and bouncing back to his best to make all down the centre of the track, much like the Lockinge winner had 35 minutes earlier, United Approach and Under The Twilight doing best of those from off the pace and worth upgrading somewhat. | [HORSE]: was easy to back and proved to be a disappointment considering how well he'd done to win over C&D last time, but that had been on good to soft and he didn't look happy from a long way out under these firmer conditions; held up, pushed along soon after halfway, never involved; he's very much in the right hands to bounce back at some stage."
"8th of 13, competitive | [RACE]: This looked a belting handicap beforehand, virtually all of these 3-y-os still improving and 6 of the 13 having won a handicap on their most recent start and, despite a steadier gallop than might have been expected, it seems sure to make for good form, the pair clear at the top of the weights coming out on top. | [HORSE]: had much more on his plate in this company, without a top claimer this time too, and didn't get the rub of the green; held up, took keen hold, headway when no room/bumped 2f out, not fully recover."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: The first of 2 new races on the card saw an even split between 3-y-os and older horses, and the exposed placed horses rather limit the form, but the winner is going the right way and had a bit to spare, leading over 1f out after the pace had been very sound. | [HORSE]: represented a stable with a fine Shergar Cup record. Slowly away again, he didn't get the clearest of runs then edged to his left under his Australia-based rider in the straight. Just failing to get up for second, he dispelled any stamina doubts."
"3rd of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A lowly affair but they went hard with Kuiama showing plenty of speed before wilting inside the final 1f, the winner coming through to make the perfect start for a new yard. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form, her claimer overdoing things on the front end this time; led, went clear home turn, headed final 1f, weakened, went off too hard; will remain of interest."
"Won | [RACE]: A fair handicap on balance and a field of largely exposed sorts, the winner proving the exception by resuming his progress despite not going with much fluency through the first half of the contest. | [HORSE]: resumed progress in comfortable fashion despite never looking that enthusiastic through the first half of the race going without cheekpieces this time, the unique track or a quirk or two perhaps to blame, but he asserted decisively once getting a run up the near rail; held up, went in snatches, outpaced 4f out, headway when short of room 2f out, led final 1f, won readily."
"10th of 16, well beaten | [RACE]: A decidedly useful handicap and the efforts of the quartet who pulled a little way clear are well worth viewing positively, the winner and third both unexposed 3-y-os, the runner-up down to a good mark and the fourth a recent winner. | [HORSE]: having second run in two days, was never able to land a blow, possibly finding the race coming too soon, though other things went wrong for him as well, stumbling badly leaving stalls then forced wide."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: An interesting handicap taken by a progressive 3-y-o who got the better of one that had shown smart form in the USA previously, the well-backed favourite in third having taken them along as far as he could. | [HORSE]: a smart four-time winner in the US, had been gelded prior to this British debut for new connections and proved weak in the market. The 5yo ran a big race, doing well to finish as close considering he failed to settle, and can surely go one better again soon."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly ordinary handicap run at a stop-start gallop notable for the achievement of the winning jockey, Hayley Turner riding her one thousandth career winner, the first female rider to do so in Europe. | [HORSE]: progressed again, overcoming trouble to bring up the hat-trick and make it 4 wins from his last 5 starts, and it seems unlikely he's finished yet; missed the break, patiently ridden, smooth headway under 3f out, going well when no room 2f out, had to pick way through over 1f out, quickened to lead approaching last ½f, won readily."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that set up well for those from off the pace, the winner and second both sweeping down the outside with clear sailing, while several towards their inside met trouble and weren't seen to best effect. | [HORSE]: has dropped to a good mark and caught the eye with how he went through the race, collared only at the death by one played just a touch later; steadied at the start, waited with, travelled best, headway over 1f out, led last ½f, headed close home; it's worth noting 4 of his 5 career wins have come on the all-weather, a positive with a winter campaign in mind."
"4th of 7, competitive | [RACE]: A strongly-run handicap that went the way of the favourite, who improved on first start for a new yard. | [HORSE]: ran respectably in a change of headgear (first-time blinkers), but didn't look all that straightforward; slowly into stride, raced off the pace, off the bridle long way out, laboured headway over 2f out, hung badly left soon after, weakened final 1f."
"3rd of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: Sax Appeal is thriving and completed the hat-trick but this was borderline farcical with the favourite quickly away and into a 10-length lead soon after the start, but the field never got any closer to him thereafter, 20+ lengths clear around the home turn before the riders in behind became urgent, the winner coming home unchallenged. | [HORSE]: did make a bit of ground from the rear but, like the rest, found the front-runner never coming back to him."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: Low-grade handicap form that's worth following, cases to be made for each of the 6 that contested a blanket finish, several of whom experienced varying degrees of hard luck, one that had caught the eye last time just prevailing. | [HORSE]: shaped very well and was arguably a touch unfortunate not to win, the winner having already begun her run by the time he was finally in the clear; in rear, travelled well, going well when not clear run 2f out, ridden final 1f, ran on, just failed; one to be interested in."
"4th of 6, competitive | [RACE]: The winner has found his niche since switched to sprinting and looks progressive all of a sudden, but this race was decided by the tactics, the winner simply afforded too much rope, the in-form second still just as interesting for the future. | [HORSE]: back up in trip, ran better than last time from a mark that continues to fall; dived right leaving stalls, in touch, took strong hold, ridden under 2f out, not quicken; he doesn't look the force of old but the handicapper is giving him a chance, worth keeping in mind if dropped into 0-80 company next time."
"Won | [RACE]: A steadily-run affair in which very few got involved behind a pair that were 1-2 throughout, the third and fifth shaping well in the circunstances. | [HORSE]: got off the mark for the season under a sound ride, settling better ridden more positively and showing a good attitude to hold on, even if he did lean into the second; made running, tackled under 2f out, edged right entering final 1f, just held on; unlikely to find circumstances so favourable next time."
"6th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: A lowly handicap in which the winner had to work harder to defy a penalty than the market suggested. | [HORSE]: back in headgear, wasn't seen to best effect having been easy to back on return after 5 months off; prominent, pushed along 2f out, short of room when hung left over 1f out, not clear run final 1f, held when no room close home; likely to be better for the run."
"Won | [RACE]: A much smaller field than the 3-y-o handicap over 1¼m the following day, and although it proved slightly unsatisfactory, the favourite one of 2 that was allowed to run after getting upset in the stalls and the race developing into something of a sprint in the straight, the first 3 certainly look horses to be positive about and some of those further back can be given a pass, so it should throw up winners; the race was marred by a significant injury to Tuscan Star. | [HORSE]: progressed again, finding the best turn of foot in a race that tested speed over stamina, but only after he'd had to wait quite some time for a clear run, and, along with the next couple home, is worth marking up on the bare form; held up, took keen hold, had to wait for gap from 3f out, switched towards inner under 2f out, quickened to lead entering last ½f, ran on; will continue to progress and is likely to be competitive at a higher level."
"5th of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: Conditions were so extreme by this stage that this is probably next to worthless as a piece of form, Cool Party always tanking in front and drawing well clear over 3f out, likely to have won by a margin in excess of 15 lengths had he not been eased considerably late in the day. | [HORSE]: was useful in this sphere at one time but those days are a very distant memory; prominent, off the bridle long way out, beaten home turn."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: With the near-side bias still in full swing this isn't form to take at face value, the first 2 seen to advantage as a result, whereas the third seemed to do well in the circumstances having been forced to make his challenge in the centre of the track, plenty in behind excused for similar reasons. | [HORSE]: shaped well, on one hand aided by a high draw, though he had to make his effort in the centre of the track away from the advantageous stand rail and probably did well to be placed as a result; waited with, ridden under 3f out, forced to switch 2f out, ran on; early days for the yard and one to be interested in from a bit below last winning mark."
"5th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: A handicap dominated by those that raced prominently, the group of 4 that finished clear up there throughout, Ernie's Valentine the second winner on the card to be having his first start for Simon Pearce. | [HORSE]: , another C&D winner returning from a short break, earns credit by virtue of doing best of those attempting to come from further back in a race where such tactics were a disadvantage. He was found to have bled."
"Won | [RACE]: A race than unfolded in somewhat typical fashion for the track with those who came to the fore either ridden positively or racing near the stand rail, but it still appeals as potentially strong form, half nursery debutants and a pair from that category split by a fellow improver; the time was the quickest of the 3 races over this trip on the card, which included a 0-80 for older horses. | [HORSE]: whose stable is going as well now as it has all year, showed much improved form to get off the mark on nursery debut, racing near the possibly favoured stand rail for most of hte way but also showing a good attitude; prominent, ridden under 3f out, switched entering final 1f, stayed on to lead final strides; an expensive purchase, there'll be even more to come when upped to 1¼m and he's one to bear in mind again next time."
"3rd of 7, competitive | [RACE]: A low-grade 3-y-o handicap, but the trio who dominated the market filled the first 3 places and will all have something to recommend them next time in similar company; the gallop only really picked up fropm halfway. | [HORSE]: is still unexposed and shaped as if ready to strike, finishing in eye-catching fashion having started slowly and endured a troubled passage in the straight. He's worth chancing to land a similar event near to hand."
"Won | [RACE]: A fair handicap run at a sound pace and the market principals came to the fore, the winner coming from a long way back to lead on the line. | [HORSE]: appreciated the good early gallop and had something to aim at in the closing stages, getting up very late. Things won't always work out for him but he's capable of being competitive off higher marks in races run to suit."
"Won | [RACE]: This looked a potentially warm race for the grade on paper and it didn't disappoint, 2 of the 3 recent winners in the line-up part of the trio who came well clear in the latter stages, and those 3 look worth following. | [HORSE]: was really well backed near the off and followed up from last time switched to turf, impressing with his strength at the finish given he'd been keener than ideal in a deeper race switched to turf; tracked pace, not settle fully, going well when led over 2f out, tackled final 1f, found extra; open to further improvement and one to keep on side."
"5th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fair handicap in which only one of the runners had previously tried this trip, the contest soundly run too, the winer nicely on top late with the third unlucky not to finish a bit closer. | [HORSE]: who has been doing well at a lowly level since switched to handicaps, wasn't seen to best effect; mid-division, not settle fully, shuffled back early on final circuit, headway out wide over 2f out, effort flattened out."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A contested pace played right into the hands of the progressive winner in this fillies' event, Sunlit Uplands coming from rear to see off one who was played a fair bit earlier, both of them sure to be of interest again next time. | [HORSE]: is proving consistent rather than progressive but handicap success shouldn't be too far away, in the heat of the battle long before the pair she split; mid-division, headway when switched over 2f out, led over 1f out, hung right, headed final 1f, plugged on; a return to 1m will do her no harm and she'll be of interest next time."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap that was run at just a steady pace, the first and third always well positioned, the runner-up doing well to split them having had to come from much further back. | [HORSE]: another making her handicap debut after getting off the mark in a Newcastle maiden, found herself out the back in a steadily run race after a poor start. Despite every assistance from the saddle, she could never get on terms with the winner and there should be another day."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A class 4 7f handicap run for the first time, taking the place of the 'lady riders' race that had been a feature of this meeting almost since women were first allowed to ride in races, at one time the main warm-up act for the King George, in recent years tucked away in the middle of a humdrum Friday afternoon, a race whose time had gone; there were quite a few interesting 3-y-os in the field, but a pair of bang-in-form older rivals held them at bay, plenty to like about the efforts of the first 2; the field raced as one group up the centre, the first 2 coming from the back of the field, the pace soon a sound one. | [HORSE]: after 10 weeks off, ran much better than he had in 2 outings in the spring, down a little in the weights but still his best effort from a stiff-enough mark; tracked pace, not settle fully, led 2f out, ridden after, headed 1f out, not quicken, kept on last ½f."
"8th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap that placed the emphasis on speed, putting an even better spin on the last-to-first effort of the winner, who impressed with the way he reeled back another who was stepping up in trip. | [HORSE]: would have been much closer had he not met Penelope's Sister going backwards inside the final furlong. He's 6lb below his last successful mark."
"5th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: Not much of interest beyond the first handful home in this modest handicap, the winner getting back on the up for a yard that has recently come good, while the fourth got no sort of run and is one to keep an eye on in the coming weeks. | [HORSE]: produced a laboured effort, consenting to run on only late in the day; slowly into stride, raced off the pace, soon off bridle, switched well inside final 1f, stayed on, nearest at the finish."
"7th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steady gallop meant this developed into a bit of a sprint, with a length and a half covering 7 of them at the line; nevertheless, the form still reads reasonably well despite a couple meeting trouble in the closing stages, Stellarmasterpiece notching a third C&D success. | [HORSE]: remains in good form and was unlucky to not to have finished a place or 2 better, his rider having to stand up in the irons near the finish so short of room was he; close up, took strong hold, led over 5f out, headed over 3f out, kept on but no room final 50 yds."
"11th of 15, competitive | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap for the grade, with the highest-rated runner Atalis Bay - who was one of several to have met trouble towards the centre of the track - running from 7 lb short of the ceiling mark of 105, while the next highest rated was in turn another 7 lb lower, the lack of quality on show further demonstrated by one who was racing from a full stone out of the weights only narrowly missing the frame; they raced as one group from the stand-side rail towards the centre of the track and, as expected, they went hell for leather, though there seemed to be no obvious positional bias, luck in running a bigger factor. | [HORSE]: after just 3 days off, has long since not belonged anywhere near this grade (well out of the handicap); raced towards stand side, in rear, uncomfortable with pace, never a threat."
"5th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: It's almost obligatory to point out the continued disconnect between this as a trial for the Cesarewitch and its impact on the big autumn staying prize itself and, unlike last year, it lacked the tonic of an improving 3-y-o progressing past some older rivals. | [HORSE]: didn't get home tackling a marathon distance for the first time, shaping much better than the bare result; held up, smooth headway over 3f out, led soon after, headed 2f out, weakened."
"Won | [RACE]: A weak nursery that was turned into a procession by the improved favourite, who made her effort well away from the stand side and had the race sewn up a long way out. | [HORSE]: justified good support to open her account despite getting away slowly, having matters in hand quite a long way out for a 6f race. She may have been aided by making her effort centre to far side but she still left the impression she's comfortably ahead of the handicapper."
"18th of 18, well beaten | [RACE]: A low-grade contest which was somewhat typical for the track with being able to race on the far rail proving a major factor, the lowest-drawn pair who finished first and third part of a quartet who went far side, the in-form runner-up coming from the highest stall and faring best of those in the centre. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden, ran no sort of race back down in grade and is going the wrong way; ridden over 3f out, always behind."
"7th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Another useful effort from Lord Melbourne in defying top-weight to score for the second time for current connections, probably a shade superior to his opposition on the day than the winning margin would suggest. | [HORSE]: blew the start before running on late. He's got a race in him when thing fall right."
"4th of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: Form to treat with caution given the slow gallop, the first 4 finishing in a heap with just 3 short heads separating them, the order likely to be different another time, Prairie Falcon arguably shaping best given the came from further back than the other 3. | [HORSE]: backed out of contention inside the final half furlong, but this was a rock-solid performance off the back of a 252-day absence. He's 2-4 on the AW, so should prove capable of winning for his new handler Ruth Carr."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A fair contest, Visibility coming from off the pace and quickly having things sewn up when hitting the front inside the final 1f. | [HORSE]: virtually refused to race sporting a first-time tongue tie, losing many lengths at the start and soon tailed off; one to treat with caution."
"20th of 21, well beaten | [RACE]: The sprint track at York has tended to offer a significant advantage to those drawn low this season, to the extent that jockeys were riding to mitigate that here, the field coming pretty much as one down the middle to far side which meant thie bias wasn't so pronounced and single-figure stalls filled only 2 of the first 13 places, trouble in running a factor for some of those drawn low, Secret Guest and The Green Man wiped out before halfway and things getting tight for others inside the final 1f, Strike Red already having put the race to bed at that point, bagging the valuable prize he'd threatened at several points this year. | [HORSE]: had been edged out by the third at Ripon last time and is best judged on that as he can have a line put through this run; mid-field, badly hampered before halfway, no chance after."
"2nd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A class-dropper just did enough to wear down one of the 3-y-os but it still doesn't say much for the remainder that they could pull so far clear. | [HORSE]: slipped on the path on the first bend so did well to recover from that and run a mighty race in defeat. He looked set to win when travelling best and kicking on in the straight, and possibly got a bit lonely out there in front, just edged out late on while finishing clear of the rest. He can surely gain compensation."
"Won | [RACE]: An ordinary sprint handicap taken by an infrequent winner who'd dropped to a good mark, the front pair pulling a little way clear. | [HORSE]: who'd dropped 5 lb below last winning mark, had cheekpieces replacing blinkers and finally snapped a losing run stretching back to September 2022, doing well to overcome some early trouble; squeezed out and shuffled back towards rear soon after start, headway on near side over 1f out, led inside final 1f, kept on; he'll remain feasibly treated, though is hardly the most reliable."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: Rule 4 25p in £ applies to all SPs The favourite Musical Mystery was withdrawn having been unruly at the start, but he'd have had a job on to contain the revitalised winner who looked back to his best to put daylight between himself and the rest at the end of a well-run race. | [HORSE]: sporting a first-time tongue-tie from an easing mark, was doing solid late work after making life difficult for herself with a poor start. Her last win came at a sharp track - Catterick - so she could well win a similar handicap back here during the winter."
"4th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A race for the 3-y-os as it turned out with that generation filling the first 3 positions, though tactics and track position played as much of a part as their relative youthfulness, as a pace that lifted sharply after halfway began to cave in late on, leading to more than once change of complexion as the trio that stayed closest to the near rail came through to dominate. | [HORSE]: probably remains in form for all she shaped at odds with a filly stepping back up in distance; mid-field, outpaced from 3f out, no chance 1f out but closed up late."
"7th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: Only one of these had run even on soft going previously, and gruelling conditions proved too much for most, only the first 2 able to raise a gallop in the closing stages, credited with some improvement but best not treated as showing significant advance, given the conditions; the field came up the centre in the straight. | [HORSE]: sold for €95,000 from Francis-Henri Graffard's stable, made an inauspicious start for his new yard after 4 months off, though much more testing conditions offered an obvious excuse; patiently ridden, labouring entering straight."
"3rd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: Much more strongly-run than the first division and it paid to be ridden patiently; there was a bit of scrimmaging as the race changed complexion in the last quarter mile. | [HORSE]: quickly back markedly in trip after securing a handicap mark had finished on the heels of 2 next-time-out winners on his penultimate run (at this trip) and showed much improved form, taking time to warm to his task but coming home well; raced off the pace, pushed along over 3f out, headway over 1f out, kept on well final 100 yds; will prove suited by 1¼m and remains capable of better."
"7th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A useful contest that looks sure to work out, the pace on the strong side and the prominently-ridden runner-up doing well as the others who made up the first 4 all came from right out the back. | [HORSE]: weakened having had a wide trip throughout."
"10th of 14, well beaten | [RACE]: A modest handicap that saw the winner bounce back trying a completely new trip, she and the other principals having come wide in a race that got tight for a few towards the inside. | [HORSE]: hasn't been in any sort of form since changing yards but can have this run in isolation ignored; tracked pace, shuffled right back around 3f out, not recover, not knocked about."
"4th of 16, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A large field of middling handicappers, quite a bit of the track explored in terms of finding the best ground, the winner solving the issue conclusively, ending up up the stand rail and storming away in the latter stages of a strongly-run race, seen to maximum advantage in coming from the rear as well, the less said about the majority the better, the distances more in keeping with a jumps race than a 1m handicap. | [HORSE]: couldn't quite match his effort from last time, but probably remains in form; in touch, effort over 2f out, challenged over 1f out, one paced."
"5th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful and competitive handicap that looks sure to work out despite it proving a little messy in the final 2f of a modestly-run affair, the likeable winner always well placed and seeing off a pair of 3-y-os, the runner-up especially one to be interested in next time, though each of the first 5 will be worth at least a second look in similar events next time. | [HORSE]: shaped well and was unlucky not to go much closer, seemingly finishing with a real rattle when denied a run late on, though it's mostly her own doing that she ends up something of a hostage of fortune, this track especially not really lending itself in her favour; slowly into stride, in rear, travelled as well as any, headway entering final 1f, keeping on when no room well inside final 1f, not recover."
"5th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: A typical handicap for the track when the field size is in double figures, the gallop sound but track position still crucial, Two Tempting getting the perfect tow into the race and pulling clear with the pacesetter, a few further back not seen to maximum effect. | [HORSE]: won at this meeting second time out last year but didn't have things go his way as he attempted to repeat the dose, shaping better than the distance beaten suggests; dropped in from poor draw, pushed along 2f out, headway when not clear run final 1f, kept on, not persevered with once held, left with too much to do, even in this well-run race."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: The stronger of the 2 divisions on paper, though it was run at a dawdle by 6f standards, the winner dictating at his own pace before quickening from the front, the runner-up having little chance from a hold-up position, needless to say the form is best treated with caution. | [HORSE]: touched off over C&D a week earlier, is on a losing run dating back to September 2020 but is well treated on his old form. The last off the bridle, he was set plenty to do in rear and was never getting to the all-the-way winner. It's surely just a matter of time before one of these goes his way."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A run-of-the-mill aprentice handicap won from the front by one who was building on a good placed effort. | [HORSE]: has a habit of finding one too good in his races and he couldn't quite reel in the winner, despite finishing well. He showed a tendency to hang left under pressure, which may have cost him. His form figures since having cheekpieces applied read 22232."
"9th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: This wasn't a strong 0-60, but the form does have some merit, the winner well on his way to becoming a course-specialist whilst the close-up third is about as consistent as it gets at this level, the pair split by one well treated on form earlier in the year. | [HORSE]: can have a line put through this run; mid-field, pushed along home turn, saddle slipped, no extra."
"2nd of 6, competitive | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap for fillies and the lightly-raced winner's improvement carried her well past the others as she came clear even after the pace had been slow. | [HORSE]: is shaping up well now, unable to live with an even more unexposed one but asked to come from further back in a falsely-run race and meeting some trouble; waited with, shaken up over 2f out, not quicken, not clear run briefly, rallied final 1f, took second final 100 yds, finished with running left."
"Won | [RACE]: A race that was messy in nature but not so disruptive as to derail the upward trajectory of the winner, who swiftly put the race to bed in the closing stages. | [HORSE]: dropped in trip after scoring over 1m2f on last week's handicap debut, confirmed herself to be nicely ahead of her mark with a smooth success. She was messed about in the early scrimmaging and raced on the outside throughout but travelled best and settled matters quickly when hitting the front."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful sprint that ought to prove strong handicap form, the winner very much on the up and leading home a trio consisting of a pair down markedly in the weights and one that arrived in search of a 4-timer. | [HORSE]: didn't really fire in a light 2023 campaign but he's dropped in the weights and this was an encouraging return from 175 days off, bumping into one who looks a smart sprinter in the making. This was his first experience of the AW and he can find a similar race."
"3rd of 29, involved in finish | [RACE]: With as many as 18 making their handicap debut this was unsurprisingly a deep contest, as it usually is, 7 of the first 10 doing so with the front pair taking their form to a smart level, the winner looking a group performer in an event that takes a little bit of explaining; they split into 2 groups with the 11 lowest drawn runners going far side, that contingent slightly ahead at halfway, though it was the stand-side group who came firmly to the fore, providing the first 7 home, with Magical Sunset best of the other side, the majority from that group either worth marking up or best excused the run, some also meeting trouble; the pace was a strong one with both sets of leaders going off too hard and it suited the closers, both Candle of Hope and Novus worth marking up considerably from those ridden prominently, winners bound to come from this. | [HORSE]: had raced prominently on most of her previous starts but was dropped out right at the back here by a jockey with two recent wins in this event. It brought about a big performance, with the filly's stamina not in any doubt."
"13th of 16, well beaten | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap that was taken apart by one making his debut in this sphere, Isle of Jura set to win by several lengths until heavily eased and clearly one to follow as he climbs the ranks; the frame was completed by a couple who arrived in good form and Outgun, who would probably have finished second granted a clear run, this trio, along with the timefigure, adding weight to the idea this is strong form. | [HORSE]: again ran below form; mid-division, raced freely, dropped away from 2f out; generally opposable."
"4th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A selling handicap in which the front pair pulled clear, Goose Rock coming from off the pace and keeping out of trouble down the centre to notch a third career success. | [HORSE]: ran respectably back down slightly in trip though didn't look the easiest of conveyances under pressure; awkward leaving stalls, mid-division, raced freely, headway out wide around halfway, pushed along over 2f out, hung left over 1f out and again inside final 1f, no extra last ½f; she may benefit from more severe headgear next time."
"5th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A handicap which saw the consistent winner get off the mark with plenty to spare, not a great deal of depth in behind, the runner-up in turn clear of the others. | [HORSE]: can have a line put through this run; poorly drawn, prominent, raced at least 3 wide until led halfway, headed over 1f out, weakening when saddle slipped last ½f, eased off, not ideally placed; type to bounce back quickly."
"8th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: This is probably only solid handicap form rather than anything more spectacular with only one of the 4 3-y-os managing to land a serious blow, the winner capitalising on a mark not far off a stone lower than when she was sent off favourite in the race last year, making all on the stand side as the field raced in 2 groups, the next 3 home having all raced up the centre, the second and third both worth siding with again next time. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form but she failed to go through fully with her effort in between horses, back up in trip but very much proven at it, possibly going through the race a little too exuberantly; stumbled start, raced centre, in touch, went with zest, had to wait for gap from 2f out, ridden final 1f, found less than looked likely, not persevered with once held."
"9th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: The complexion of this competitive affair changed only late on, a strong pace setting it up for those from mid-field and further back and those in the places swept past the well-handicapped Farasi Lane after that one had gone through it best of all. | [HORSE]: easy to back, is in much better heart than recent form figures suggest, going off too hard on this occasion back down in trip; led until over 2f out, weakened entering final 1f."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: This is the sort of low-grade 3-y-o handicap that often works out and each of the 4 that came clear will be of interest over the coming weeks, all the more so if any of them get to tackle older horses; the pace was sound and there were racing a long way, the winner coming from further back of the principals and getting up late. | [HORSE]: up 4f in distance for this handicap debut, did nothing quickly and shapes like a thorough stayer in the making."
"4th of 7, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Plenty in with chances when the pair that raced clear came back to the pack over 2f out, the favourite stuck with nowhere to go as things got tight down the inner, the winner out of harm's way and digging deep to repel one that had sat last most of the way. | [HORSE]: dropped in grade on the quickest ground he has tackled, was unfortunate not to finish much closer having got no run against the rail when the leader weakened back into his lap. He can easily be given another chance."
"7th of 7, competitive | [RACE]: A slow early gallop set the tone for what became something of a messy sprint handicap. | [HORSE]: well backed, can have a line put through this run; dwelt, held up, raced freely, headway when denied a run over 1f out, held when not clear run again inside final 1f, not unduly punished."
"5th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A strongly-run and decidedly useful handicap, and though it's a Lincoln trial in name only - none of the first 6 are entered at Doncaster - it's a strong piece of form in the context of the all-weather season, the front pair and the fourth thriving, whilst the third has been given a chance by the assessor. | [HORSE]: boasts a good record when fresh and ran creditably after 7 months off, proving himself fully at this trip in the process; mid-field, hampered briefly home turn, progress early in straight, every chance 1f out, one paced."
"26th of 27, well beaten | [RACE]: Another fiercely competitive handicap at the meeting this week that proved tough to crack, though ground-wise at least it unfolded on a more level playing field than can sometimes be the case, the field initially racing as 2 groups, the majority going towards the far side with a group of 10 from the highest stalls, with the exception of Spangled Mac, coming more towards the centre, the groups converging around halfway, 3 from each side filling the first 6 places, the smaller group on the whole performing better, though that was perhaps more pace related, the far side group doing a bit too much in the early stages; the field was reduced by one after Tanmaawy got loose at the start. | [HORSE]: is a prolific winner in Scandinavia, including by 11 lengths on his most recent outing but ran poorly having had too much use made of him; led overall, headed over 2f out, weakened."
"9th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: This wasn't a deep race for the grade and although the 'right' horses came to the fore - the trio behind the winner all of some interest again - there's a chance that the dominant winner isn't quite so good as this performance makes him look, a relatively cautious view best taken of the form. | [HORSE]: found himself poorly positioned after one of his regular slowish starts and never threatened back from seven months off. He has good overall record on the two tracks here and will be lower than scoring on the July Course last summer once reassessed."
"6th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A reasonably open-looking affair in which David Nolan got the fractions spot-on aboard the all-the-way winner. | [HORSE]: was another who benefited from the good early gallop. He was keeping on from the back when tightened up for room inside the final 2f."
"Won | [RACE]: Intervention gave the field the slip early in the straight but was worn down by the thriving favourite, none of others threatening, | [HORSE]: shouldering a 5lb penalty for his 1.75l defeat of Intervention over C&D six days earlier, completed his four-timer with almost nothing to spare, maintaining his unbeaten record in blinkers. Up a total of 12lb since his winning sequence began, he looked up against it for much of the straight, but he kept responding to pressure. It would be no surprise to see him given a break now."
"9th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: The favourite was one of the sufferers from a steady gallop that limits the bare form somewhat, but there was plenty to like about the way the first 2 came clear. | [HORSE]: not seen since finishing second to State Occasion in this very race 12 months earlier, shaped as if retaining ability but looked a little rusty; handy, not quicken over 2f out, short of room, faded, not persevered with once held; likely to be better for the run, while an entry in the Group 2 Blandford Stakes gives an indication of the regard in which she's held."
"5th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: Half the field had run against each other in a similar event over C&D a fortnight earlier, the winner and third on that occasion the first 2 home this time, though the heavily-backed favourite would probably have just pegged them back had he not found his path blocked when attempting to start his move from the back. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form, his recent C&D second franked by the first 2 in this; in rear, not clear run over 2f out, stayed on, never nearer."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fascinating fillies' handicap that saw a trio of promising 3-y-os finish clear of the others, though the winner was much the best on the day, quickening right away from them 1f out and adding to a really encouraging profile. | [HORSE]: , up 2lb for her Yarmouth win, didn't have things go all her way but probably bumped into one here."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A one-sided handicap, Caprelo justifying favouritism in taking fashion, more than confirming himself a stayer to stay on the right side of. | [HORSE]: has struggled for consistency this year but produced on his better efforts; steadied at the start, in rear, headway when not clear run 2f out, stayed on, nearest at the finish; he remains above his previous winning mark despite 6 runs without success since."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap in which they split into 2 groups early on, the winner picking up strongly to collar the long-time leader down the centre of the track having initially begun his effort towards the stand rail. | [HORSE]: a winner on his stable debut at Chelmsford last month off 4lb lower and gelded subsequently, looked booked for third at best with over a furlong to run, but he suddenly clicked into gear and picked up the leader in the nick of time. He could improve again for a stiff 6f."
"8th of 16, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A 3-y-o event that's usually a deep contest, this running looking no exception with some strong form lines represented, as many 6 of them reappearing from the race won by Quinault at York last month, including the first 4 that day, and a trio from that contingent made the frame again along with a reliable type, the first 2 progressive and clear of the rest; they raced in one large group and, as can be the case here, it paid to be handy, Tough Enough best of those from the rear, whilst the majority of those who raced on the wings can either be excused or marked up, most notably Be Frank and Frankness. | [HORSE]: a Listed runner-up over 5f at Sandown, made his ground towards the far rail from stall 16, which is usually not the place to be here. Said to have clipped heels early, he's better than this but may not be easy to place from a mark in the high 90s."
"12th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: The winner was a long-standing maiden who was suddenly revived by the fitting of headgear, the result not in doubt once he took over approaching the final 1f, while further back several weren't seen to best effect, perhaps most notably Winchurch, who continues to get little luck. | [HORSE]: had run into plenty of traffic at Lingfield last month and suffered a similar fate here, seemingly travelling quite strongly but having nowhere to go for the final 2f. Things will fall right for him at some point."
"Won | [RACE]: A falsely-run handicap in which the order didn't change much, the winner allowed to dictate and probably not achieving so much as a quick glance at the result might suggest. | [HORSE]: very much had the run of the race as she got off the mark, her mind made up for her this time by reverting to positive tactics and allowed a soft lead by her rivals; dictated, kicked on over 4f out, in command entering final 1f, ridden out."
"3rd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: The leader went off too hard and the 3-y-os came to the fore, the front trio all showing improved form as Romantic Spirit made it 3 wins from 4 starts this season, the second and third having only one previous run in handicaps between them. | [HORSE]: off 10 months ahead of first start since leaving Darryll Holland, was upped in trip for all-weather debut and took a step forward, entitled to come on for this outing as well; mid-division, headway under pressure from over 2f out, stayed on final 1f; is the type that her new yard does well with and is one to bear in mind, especially as she's eligible to run in lesser contests."
"6th of 6, competitive | [RACE]: A very modest gallop meant this turned into a sprint in the straight and the form is decidedly flimsy as a result. | [HORSE]: shouldn't be judged too harshly on this after just 7 days off, asked too much trying to sustain a move into a quickening pace for more than 3f; patiently ridden, good headway over 3f out to go prominent, hung left 1f out, effort flattened out."
"5th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: The testing conditions did for plenty of these, the stamina-laden winner up there throughout and a lot hardier in the finish than the perennially weak finisher that loomed up as her main threat. | [HORSE]: could have been expected to put up a better show but it was subsequently reported that he bled."
"9th of 19, competitive | [RACE]: A pair of outsiders filling the first 2 positions felt rather fitting considering the muddling nature of this year's Kensington Palace, as the complexion of a soundly-run race changed relay-style in the straight, the winner played last of the principals - and also widest of them - after others had trodden a similar path to get to the front briefly before she struck, any number on their inside not getting the gaps when needed as they returned very well clustered. | [HORSE]: wasn't able to secure so positive a position this time, not that such tactics were a blessing the way this unfolded, her preceding second here franked by a couple ahead with a view to her running right up to her best again next time; settled mid-field out wide, not quicken 2f out, rallied well inside final 1f."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Not a particularly strong race for the grade and there wasn't much pace on early doors, several racing freely, but the first 2 both looked better than ever in forging clear inside the final 1f. | [HORSE]: disappointed in a couple of hurdles for Dan Skelton just under a year apart but, having had another wind op, this former French Flat winner fared a lot better returned to the Flat for a new yard. He's presumably had a few issues but can build on this if he gets a clear run at his racing now."
"Won | [RACE]: Only 3 gave their running in this handicap, but their efforts shouldn't be underestimated, the winner quite impressive as he saw off a couple of handily-treated rivals who were making their reappearance. | [HORSE]: had dipped below last winning mark and showed the benefit of recent run, looking at least as good as ever as he won this race for the second year in succession, underlining his effectiveness when the mud is flying in the process; chased leader, travelled powerfully, had to wait for gap home turn, got split over 1f out, quickened to lead final 1f, went clear and won readily."
"6th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap littered with unexposed types and this should throw up its fair share of winners, the well-supported Cavolo Nero taken widest away from the scrimmaging in the straight to score with a bit up his sleeve. | [HORSE]: dropped into her first handicap after a swing at a Group 3 at Newbury, was a handful in the preliminaries and this probably isn't the run to judge her on."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: The progressive winner was allowed to dictate and had far too much speed for his rivals stepping up in trip but, despite the gallop, it's still worth being positive about the form, his 2 most interesting rivals getting closest to him. | [HORSE]: , arguably unlucky not to break her duck at Wolverhampton, did well to finish third given she raced at the back off a slow gallop here, a poor start not helping her cause."
"Won | [RACE]: Fair form by the pair who pulled clear in this handicap, but plenty further back failed to fire in the conditions so this isn't a race to dwell on. | [HORSE]: had shown himself well suited by testing ground in France as a 3-y-o, unsurprisingly given his high knee action, and turned in best effort of the year back under such conditions to do some repair work to his strike rate; mid-field, rapid headway around 3f out, challenged over 1f out, carried head a bit high but essentially looked more straightforward than is often the case, led dying strides."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap littered with unexposed types and this should throw up its fair share of winners, the well-supported Cavolo Nero taken widest away from the scrimmaging in the straight to score with a bit up his sleeve. | [HORSE]: on turf debut, had been gelded ahead of this handicap debut and was also sporting first-time blinkers. Any one of those things may have helped him post a good reappearance, suffering from a lack of daylight but leaving the firm impression this opening mark can be converted."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A lowly 3-y-o contest run at a fair pace, the experienced winner doing enough to score for the first time in handicap company, the inexperienced runner-up possibly unlucky not to get the job done. | [HORSE]: showed improved form making handicap debut, probably unlucky not to win in the end, this opening mark clearly an attractive one; mid-field, raced freely, appeared to take false step soon after halfway, headway when short of room over 1f out, forced to switch final 1f, finished well, just failed; open to further improvement."
"5th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: The early pace in this handicap was strong, and while the leaders overdid things, there wasn't a complete pace collapse and the form looks reliable enough, the winner coming back to his very best under his ideal conditions to repeat his win in the race as a 3-y-o back in 2021. | [HORSE]: had beaten the winner at Haydock earlier in the year and looked back in that sort of form, not getting the rub of the green like one or 2; held up, pushed along early in straight, headway when short of room 2f out, kept on once in clear."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A borderline useful handicap, but one where a bit of progression went a long way, the form probably just ordinary for the level. | [HORSE]: for whom the return to Southwell looked a positive, was last off the bridle but had to switch for a clear run and he couldn't find a strong enough finish. He's probably a little vulnerable off his current mark."
"Won | [RACE]: This may have gone to one of the outsiders, but it still looks solid enough, the pair who chased him home both arriving in good nick. | [HORSE]: turned in one of his better efforts this winter to end a 2-year losing run; disputed lead, went on around halfway, pushed along under 2f out, tackled final 1f, had nothing to spare; isn't an obvious type to follow up."
"Won | [RACE]: A desperately weak affair, though the winner did appear to show improved form in getting the better of a long-standing maiden. | [HORSE]: just out of the handicap, showed improved form to get off the mark; in touch, headway over 1f out, led inside final 1f, kept on; this wasn't much of a race and she doesn't strike as an obvious type to follow up, for all she's less exposed than most at this level."
"5th of 6, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fair 'hands and heels' apprentice handicap which it looked as though Alright Sunshine would win, but his rider took things a shade cosily and was caught on the line by one of the outsiders lunging late down the centre. | [HORSE]: wasn't disgraced, promising more than he delivered having raced freely back up in trip; prominent, raced freely, challenged early in straight, found less than looked likely."
"9th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: An ordinary contest which went the way of the thriving favourite, a strong gallop playing into her hands. | [HORSE]: probably remains in form but it's a little concerning he couldn't go through fully with his effort; waited with, smooth progress over 2f out, ridden over 1f out, found less than looked likely, not persevered with once held."
"Won | [RACE]: Another wide-margin victory for the rapidly-improving It's Tim, who extended his winning sequence to 4 without having to break sweat. | [HORSE]: is improving in leaps and bounds and defied a 10-lb penalty without having to come out of second gear, this his fourth success in the last 16 days and his winning spree looks set to continue before the handicapper has chance to catch up with him (holds an entry at Nottingham on Saturday); held up, travelled strongly, headway circuit out, led on bridle over 3f out, went clear 2f out, hard held."
"Won | [RACE]: King of The Kippax running so poorly meant there was no real opposition to Caius Chorister who ran out about as easy a winner of a handicap as there'll be all summer. | [HORSE]: had got up to beat Wagga Wagga at Salisbury and followed that one in scoring by a wide margin next time, bringing up the hat-trick with the minimum of fuss in a very thin race; awkward leaving stalls, soon led, travelled well, quickened under 4f out, went clear 3f out, hard held."
"2nd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A run-of-the-mill handicap in which the gallop only picked up from halfway, leading to a blanket finish, the sole 3-y-o in the line up finding a bit of progress to justify favouritism | [HORSE]: boasts a good record over this C&D and went close to taking advantage of a slight drop in grade; in touch, pushed along over 2f out, kept on well final 1f, just failed; is a largely consistent type who should remain competitive."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Low-grade fare and they crawled round until early in the straight, the winner all out to hold off one that sat last most of the way. | [HORSE]: stepped up on reappearance run returned to 1½m, held up off the steady gallop and finishing best; waited with, headway early in straight, switched 2f out, kept on well, just failed."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful, albeit modestly run, 3-y-o handicap which still went the way of the strongest stayer. | [HORSE]: kept on strongly in the closing stages to register a first success on turf. This was a personal best and he may prove stronger still over even further."
"4th of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: Lots of these had been in decent heart but, in truth, this handicap revolved around one horse, the former Triumph Hurdle winner Pentland Hills, on his return from a long absence, made to work hard by a plucky rival and a stop-start pace that ensured he took a while to extricate himself from trouble. | [HORSE]: dropped 3lb since his reappearance, kept on strongly from a long way back. His win for Andrew Balding in 2020 came on testing ground, and he's potentially well treated if he can build on this."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A class 6 handicap in which not many gave their running, Chourmo the one to take from the race, meeting all sorts of trouble and likely to have won had he enjoyed a fair shake of the dice. | [HORSE]: down in trip, would have gone close had he not been stopped in his run until inside the last furlong, running on well but having no chance of getting to the first two. He was clear of the remainder and looks capable of winning from a mark in the mid-50s."
"3rd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: They came stand side in this standard class 6 handicap, the in-form Impressor striking for the second successive time, albeit in a race that probably didn't take all that much winning, while the third wasn't seen to best effect. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect and would have gone closer with a better run through, though it's debatable whether he'd have beaten the winner, not the heartiest when all's said and done; chased leaders, took strong hold, not clear run inside final 1f, carried head awkwardly but finished with running left."
"Won | [RACE]: An element of deja vu here, with the 1-3-4-5 filling the same positions as when meeting at this track earlier in the month, Singing The Blues making most this time. | [HORSE]: back up in trip, shrugged off a poor effort to record his second course win of the month, again showing a good attitude; made running, kicked on early in straight, headed over 2f out, rallied to lead again late on."
"Won | [RACE]: A low-grade affair but still form that makes plenty of sense with a couple of the more likely ones coming well clear late on, the pair of them 2 of the widest in the straight on a card that favoured such tactics. | [HORSE]: is holding his form really well and resumed winning ways, back under the same claimer as for his previous win, his stamina for further just winning the day on this soft ground; waited with, steady headway from 5f out, went on over 2f out, edged right, headed 1f out, rallied to lead again final strides."
"6th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A handicap that saw the places filled by a trio of veterans who have fallen down the weights, the form nothing special, even for this lowly grade. | [HORSE]: seems to be in a lull for now; chased leader, ridden over 3f out, weakened final 1f."
"7th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A soundly-run sprint handicap and a result that makes plenty of sense, Fine Interview returning to his best under optimum conditions to get the better of a couple who came here on the back of good recent efforts with only the next one home giving their running. | [HORSE]: without the headgear, fared no better than last time and seems to be in a lull for now; chased leaders, pushed along soon after halfway, weakened early in straight."
"7th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A fair handicap that looked to be run at good clip courtesy of the typically-headstrong Finn Russell until the pace steadied around halfway, that one able to fend off all bar the patiently-ridden Mighty Quiet; the form strikes as sound for all none of the more obvious improvers found much progress. | [HORSE]: won this race last year but there's been an element of going through the motions about him this season and he again failed to make an impression after 9 weeks off; in rear, not clear run over 2f out, never involved."
"4th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A typically modest contest for a race of this type, the well-backed winner scoring with a bit in hand. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden, after just 6 days off, underperformed; mid-field, took strong hold, tracked pace around halfway, ridden around 2f out, one paced; he just seems to be going through the motions at present."
"10th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A few of the 3-year-olds didn't fire but the winner certainly wasn't among them, chased home by a pair of year-older fillies who help to give the form a very solid look, as does a time nearly 2 seconds quicker than the preceding 3-y-o class 3 handicap. | [HORSE]: ended last season a bit out of sorts and fared no better after 6 months off, trying a 2f longer trip and more to her performance than that alone; dropped out, struggling under 3f out, never involved."
"10th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: Hard to think this form is particularly robust, a modest gallop very much favouring those ridden close to the pace, the first 2 getting first run on the third, who didn't help himself by hanging. | [HORSE]: continues out of sorts; dwelt, in rear, struggling under 3f out, always behind."
"9th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A run-of-the-mill handicap that set up well for those ridden with a bit of patience, a strong pace enabling the winner to settle better than of late and snap a long losing run on first start for new connections. | [HORSE]: followed a below-par effort with an even worse one; in touch, ridden 2f out, weakened final 1f."
"9th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: A race of changing complexion in the closing stages, Shark Two One moving through the race like the best handicapped but delivered too soon and picked off by a couple that played their hand later, though Obee Jo was hardly winning out of turn having edged back down the weights. | [HORSE]: followed a below-par effort with an even worse one; prominent, weakened quickly 3f out."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fillies' handicap blown apart by a handicap/all-weather debutant, Vibrant Pearl effortlessly coming from last to first and scoring with plenty more in hand than the bare margin implies, another unexposed 3-y-o chasing her home. | [HORSE]: who looked a potential improver for the drop back to sprinting, ran on well once she got a split. She was flattered to get as close as she did to the winner, but she's open to further improvement as a sprinter."
"Won | [RACE]: A bog-standard handicap taken by one who hadn't shown form for a long time; the pace was modest. | [HORSE]: who was winning for the first time since October 2018, found things opening up nicely for her from the turn in, and she ran on well to hand Collen Storey a first win in Britain on his 15th ride since coming over from South Africa."
"Won | [RACE]: A steadily-run amateur riders' event and the front pair were always to the fore. | [HORSE]: back in a tongue strap but without the headgear after 9 weeks off, also down markedly in trip, and ran up to best to shed maiden tag; chased leader, pushed along 2f out, got gap over 1f out, led final 100 yds, better placed than most; isn't an obvious type to follow up."
"Won | [RACE]: A modest sprint that set up well for those ridden with a bit of patience, an infrequent winner coming home narrowly in front; Gowanbuster was withdrawn at the start having broken through his stall. | [HORSE]: finally snapped a losing run stretching back to March of last year, impressing with how she went through the race and seeing things out well enough and, although she'll remain reasonably treated on old form, isn't an obvious type to follow up; mid-field, travelled well, smooth headway to lead over 1f out, ridden final 1f, kept on."
"Won | [RACE]: A poor turnout but it turned into a good race, nothing to split a pair of gradually progressive 3-y-os at the line, Havana Goldrush not looking entirely straightforward and proving unable to get the job done outright having loomed up. | [HORSE]: found some progress to resume winning ways after just 5 days off but left the impression he should have won this outright, hanging fire having loomed up going well, this just his second outing in handicaps and potentially more to come from him if proving more professional in time; in touch, travelled well, headway 2f out, challenged over 1f out, led final 1f, carried head awkwardly and hung left, joined on line."
"Won | [RACE]: A slowly-run affair and the form may well prove flimsy, nothing able to land a blow on a trio of handily-ridden ones. | [HORSE]: after 8 weeks off, belatedly added to his first success more than 2 years earlier, though he very nearly threw it away late; chased leaders, not clear run around 2f out, switched inside soon after, headway to lead inside final 1f, carried head awkwardly late, just held on."
"8th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The fact it was 10/3 the field suggested there was an open feel to this low-grade affair and an in-form pair who'd met last time led them home, the winner finding some improvement for the fitting of headgear. | [HORSE]: is becoming increasingly temperamental; dwelt, raced off the pace, flashed tail soon after start, brief headway 2f out, flashed tail again straight, no further impression."
"10th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: The 3-y-o favourite failed to progress but the remaining trio from that age group filled the places, one that's thrived for a change in yard going clear close home; they were well strung out by the back straight though few got involved from further back than mid-field, Billy No Mates shaping well with that in mind. | [HORSE]: back on turf, is becoming increasingly temperamental; dwelt, mid-field, off the bridle before most, dropped away over 2f out."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A run-of-the-mill class 6 handicap. | [HORSE]: wasted no time getting back to form, doing well to get as close as he did having blown the start, worth noting he won over C&D last autumn from a similar mark; restless in stalls and very slowly away, soon behind, pushed along under 2f out, headway over 1f out, ran on, nearest at the finish."
"7th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A useful contest taken apart by an unexposed 3-y-o who looks well on his way to better things, the remainder in the places also ridden prominently which seemed to be the order of the day. | [HORSE]: has an excellent record at this track, including when winning the last 2 renewals of this contest, 3 lb lower this time around but he's yet to fire this season; very slowly away, raced off the pace, in touch halfway, dropped away under 2f out."
"4th of 7, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A nursery run at a steady pace but the leading trio came clear, the first and third both coming from further off the pace than the runner-up, the winner looking rejuvanted for his new yard. | [HORSE]: who sweated up beforehand, failed to improve under a return to positive tactics, but is proven over further and may have been seen to better effect if setting a stronger gallop; led, tackled over 2f out, headed approaching final 1f, left behind soon after."
"11th of 15, well beaten | [RACE]: A strong-looking race confined to those who'd won no more than once, as many as 6 of them having done so on their latest outing, most also making their first start in a nursery and such types came to the fore, the well-backed Sword Maker thumping them in a good time despite the next best runner from a double-figure draw managing only seventh, the field having raced in 2 groups until around halfway. | [HORSE]: edgy beforehand (wore red hood), had Buick booked for nursery debut but possibly found the race coming too soon having won after a mid-season break just over a fortnight earlier, also drawn highest of all; raced stand side, mid-field, pushed along 3f out, struggling when eased over 1f out."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap that saw a couple who arrived in good heart fill the first 2 places, whilst the gallop was reasonable, too. | [HORSE]: under a penalty after just 3 days off, couldn't complete a quickfire hat-trick but again ran well; prominent, every chance entering final 1f, worried out of it."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair nursery which saw a pair of class droppers come to the fore and pull a little way clear as the favourite underperformed. | [HORSE]: looked the likeliest winner once hitting the front but was worried out of it. He should appreciate dropping back in distance."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that went to a last-time-out winner, the runner-up probably also fairly weighted but not the heartiest; the gallop was reasonable. | [HORSE]: couldn't have asked for a better trip and his chance was there for all to see inside the last furlong, but he either could not or would not go past the winner, with his finishing effort especially looking rather tame. Now 0-14 and placed nine times, he is proving expensive to follow and is one to treat with caution."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: One who's fallen back to a good mark split a pair in top form at the end of a well-run contest that seems sure to prove solid form for the grade. | [HORSE]: returned to form from out of the blue, the drop back in trip as well as the drop in grade to his advantage, as was seemingly a more patient ride, though he still failed to get the job done having looked the most likely winner entering the final 1f; mid-field, went with zest, headway over 2f out, challenged over 1f out, led briefly inside final 1f, outbattled."
"Won | [RACE]: Not many got involved in this steadily-run affair, but the pair who fought out the finish are both relatively low mileage for their current yards and should remain of some interest. | [HORSE]: , who kicked off in handicaps back in June off a mark of 67, has dropped a stone in the weights since then. He made some good late headway over the extended mile here last time, and moving back up in trip proved a good decision. In a race that wasn't strongly run, he sat just off the leader and outbattled him up the straight. He's open to progress from this mark."
"Won | [RACE]: Nine non runners - most on account of the firm ground - meant this was a far less competitive handicap than usual; it also developed in unusual fashion, Island Brave setting a slow pace initially then taken on and passed by Amtiyaz after about 6f, the pair soon racing at least 8l clear of the rest and meaning the pursuers were mostly hard at it 3f out to try and claw the pair back. | [HORSE]: had given notice on his previous start that his turn mightn't be far away and, 3 lb lower than when winning this race 12 months earlier, followed up in determined fashion, arguably a bit better than the result too after being taken on for the lead by Amtiyaz a long way out, that one paying the price; made running, headed back straight, chased leader after, shaken up over 3f out, led again over 1f out, held on gamely."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A run-of-the-mill handicap run at no more than a fair pace, the smooth-travelling winner getting the job done only narrowly in the end. | [HORSE]: showed signs of a revival last time and this display confimed she is back to something like her best. She rallied gamely after being headed and was coming back at the winner late on."
"Won | [RACE]: A tightly-knit handicap short on potential, but it produced a busy finish with 4 in line close home, the winner digging deep to edge it despite going left under pressure and not helping her rivals. | [HORSE]: had the outside draw to contend with but was given a positive ride and held the lead going into the turn. On a card that was favouring those prominently ridden, she battled on well to fight off several challenges."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Improvers fought out the finish in a modest 3-y-o handicap. | [HORSE]: whose latest effort could be ignored, battled back most gamely after being headed by the winner and there should be a modest event in her somewhere."
"12th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A run-of-the-mill sprint in which the front pair pulled clear, the favourite reeling in the front-running Giddy Aunt and notching a second C&D success of the season. | [HORSE]: ran even worse back down in trip; prominent soon after start, off the bridle long way out and lost place before halfway, soon beaten."
"4th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: Good efforts from the pair of 3-y-os that raced clear of the others throughout, the second allowed to stride on this time and responding well with only the well-treated winner getting past him inside the final 1f. | [HORSE]: a consistent sort with winning form over C&D, seemed to be going well enough turning in but he was still well adrift of the front pair and made no impression once off the bridle. He is already due a 1lb rise."
"10th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A basement-grade contest but one at least run at a sound pace, Makalu making his first start at this level a winning one. | [HORSE]: didn't arrive in much form but, without his usual headgear, shaped as if amiss; led, kicked on entering straight, headed over 2f out, stopped quickly (jockey reported that the gelding had lost his action)."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A messy finish - they returned well bunched and a few failed to secure a clear run - points towards potentially muddling form for what on paper had looked one of the most interesting handicaps of the evening. | [HORSE]: found his run of good form coming to a halt with a whimper, possibly amiss to drop away from mid-field as quickly as he did over 2f out."
"6th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A modestly-run affair which the progressive favourite had sewn up from over 1f out. | [HORSE]: , up 5lb for last month's Southwell win, failed to get involved having refused to settle."
"Won | [RACE]: The early gallop was completely pedestrian, making it surprising that the other 4 apprentices allowed the first 2 to break so far clear around halfway, the 2 of them not for catching in a race in which the jockeys were not permitted to use their whips. | [HORSE]: rather took charge of his rider but such was the advantage he gained from an uncontested lead that it didn't matter, making it 2 wins from 4 starts for Keady as sole licensee; dictated, refused to settle, drew clear with runner-up around halfway, edged right over 1f out, tackled final 1f, just held on, very much had the run of the race."
"3rd of 7, competitive | [RACE]: A modest contest in which the eventual second was allowed to dictate; the field came down the centre before drifting back onto the far rail. | [HORSE]: under a penalty for recent C&D win, would have finished upsides the second had had he not been hampered as the winner edged across to the rail; ran never far away, raced freely, switched under 2f out, carried left, badly hampered final 100 yds, not recover."
"4th of 7, competitive | [RACE]: There was a tactical element to this, the tempo only really lifting from 4f out, Haku the beneficiary of a good ride as he beat a couple who were always to the fore. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden, shaped as if still in good form; in touch, raced freely, shuffled back around 4f out, shaken up soon after, laboured headway over 1f out, plugged on, not ideally placed."
"5th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: An ordinary handicap, half the field 3-y-os but from that group only the all-the-way winner making the places. | [HORSE]: in first-time cheekpieces (on Flat) was given a considerate return from an 11-month break (from jumps); raced off the pace, shaken up over 2f out, never involved; next run should reveal more."
"7th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A muddling handicap but there's plenty to like about the winner and the third, Jersey Rocs going the right way now and overcoming some trouble in running, while the third flew home up the inside. | [HORSE]: shaped as if needing the run after 11 weeks off; mid-field, raced freely, pushed along out wide over 1f out, weakened final 1f; next run should reveal more."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary gallop lifted appreciably before the home turn and that played into the hands of a patiently-ridden one that had already been successful this week. | [HORSE]: resumed progress after 6 months off, rather bumping into one in the winner; handy, went on over 2f out, headed final 1f, no match for winner; still unexposed at middle distances and will remain of interest."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Solid form for the grade, the first 2 in good order and both getting past one that is down to a handy mark now. | [HORSE]: ran well and shouldn't be long in getting his head in front again, not the quickest away once more but able to hold a good position this time and edged out only by one in top form; dwelt, in touch, pushed along over 1f out, led final 1f, headed line; will remain of interest."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap in which plenty were still in with a chance 1f out, though the well-bred winner still did well to run down one that goes well at this track. | [HORSE]: ran creditably on handicap debut, always well placed and seeing out her race well. She should improve sufficiently to win something similar."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: An open betting market for the this low-grade handicap and the one that went off favourite kept on best having always been in the firing line. | [HORSE]: , off since winning at Thirsk in June, made a pleasing comeback reappearance but couldn't run down the race-fit winner. He's been consistent since handicapping and should improve for the run."
"3rd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: Borderline useful efforts from the best-backed pair in a handicap that seemed to feature horses at various stages of readiness for the season; the gallop was on the steady side. | [HORSE]: shaped encouragingly after 6 months off having been easy to back, this likely to help put him spot on for next time, and he's lurking on a very handy mark; held up, good headway 2f out, every chance until 1f out; one to look out for."
"2nd of 29, involved in finish | [RACE]: As is usually the case, this is a contender for the strongest handicap of the season, almost half of the field successful on their latest start and plenty arriving on the up as a result, the first 3 all doing so and improving again with Docklands and New Endeavour, who raced on opposite sides of the track, having this between them from 1f out and taking their form to a smart level; they split into 2 almost equal groups with stall 17 the dividing point, the far side seeming to hold the advantage, responsible for 7 of the first 10, the winner therefore worth marking up considerably having pulled well clear of the rest stand side, the hat-trick seeking runner-up from that group, Surely Not, also better than the result, as was the well-backed Quantum Impact who went all the way from the favoured side to the other when mounting his challenge, plenty from the latter pack having excuses; all in all this is a contest to follow for the coming months with the majority yet to take on their elders, and it will throw up plenty of winners. | [HORSE]: is in top form at present and, upped in trip, eked out a bit more improvement from a much higher mark than Kempton, first home in his group and finding only a group performer masquerading as a handicapper too good, impressing once again with how he went about things; raced far side, mid-field, travelled strongly, led under pressure under 2f out, edged right entering final 1f, headed last ½f; another rise awaits but he's one to look out for in more top-end handicaps for the rest of the season, having shown enough to go close in listed races, too."
"7th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A fair handicap and probably a good race for the grade, the winner better than ever starting out for a new yard and chased home by several that are down to handy marks now, so it's a race to view positively for the level. | [HORSE]: again without usual headgear worn for previous yard, was supported in the betting and stepped up on reappearance run despite the 1f shorter trip back on turf; slowly into stride, in rear, headway 1f out, one paced, not unduly punished, unsuited by the drop in trip; is below last winning mark and will prove suited by a return to 7f."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A tight finish to the fairly useful handicap, with an in-form veteran coming out narrowly on top from one who was back to form following a lesser effort over further. | [HORSE]: who'd dipped below last winning mark, appreciated the drop back to 5f and wasted no time getting back on track, having to challenge wider than the winner possibly the difference between victory and defeat; mid-field, headway out wide over 1f out, led final 1f, headed inside last ½f, no extra."
"5th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair handicap that should prove solid form for the level, the front pair returning to form, while the next 3 all showed promise coming back from breaks. | [HORSE]: belatedly showed signs of retaining ability after a long absence and he's now well handicapped on his 4yo form. He's happiest on slow turf and there should be plenty of options for him."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A bit of a messy race, with several hampered at the start, while a couple didn't get the best of runs late on, the winner always well placed away from any trouble and getting the jump on the runner-up, who was unlucky not to win. | [HORSE]: well backed, benefited as expected from the step back up in trip and was unlucky not to win given he met some late trouble; dived left leaving stalls, mid-field, headway over 2f out, not clear run over 1f out, switched 1f out, kept on, just failed; it's a while since he last got his head in front but he's clearly well handicapped nowadays."
"3rd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: An oridnary handicap taken by one who's had a good winter, Buraback getting up late on to nail a maiden who's proving consistent. | [HORSE]: never really looked like winning but finished close up, continuing his consistent run of form."
"3rd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sprint handicap in which only those on the pace figured, the veteran winner in good form right now and scoring decisively from stall 1. | [HORSE]: , a prolific winner on the AW, is a solid consistent performer and made a fine return from a break."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A standard hanidcap for the grade, the winner and second up there throughout and out of trouble, while a couple of the beaten horses weren't seen to best effect, most notably the fourth. | [HORSE]: didn't get the breaks, denied a clear run more than once and yet not beaten far at the line. She looked unlucky."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap which set up well for one that has never been lower in the weights, Heartrate seeing it out best to edge out the in-form favourite. | [HORSE]: making a quick reappearance in a change of headgear, was probably unlucky as his forward momentum was halted at a crucial stage."
"Won | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap won by one getting off the mark with something to spare so it's not likely to prove strong form, though a couple of hold-up horses are better than they were able to show here. | [HORSE]: an 11-race maiden coming into this, responded well to first-time blinkers, doing well to pick up so well off a steady pace, eventually bolting up. He would be of interest if turning out under a penalty."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair sprint handicap, with the improved winner making all, while a couple just in behind weren't seen to best effect. | [HORSE]: sporting first-time cheekpieces, travelled notably well for a long way, but he too had to wait for a run and then took time to pick up once finding daylight. A winner over 6f here last month off a 3lb lower mark, he looks in need of a return to further."
"5th of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: A fair handicap in which the top 2 in the betting came clear inside the final 1f, Uncle Dick digging deep to gain his third C&D victory within the last month. | [HORSE]: was well held after 16 months off, almost certainly in need of the outing; in rear, switched to near rail over 3f out, short of room soon after, pushed along over 2f out, dropped away over 1f out."
"5th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modest handicap that ought to prove reasonable enough form for the grade; the free-going favourite ensured a strong pace. | [HORSE]: was a warm order to build on his recent Musselburgh second but was too lit up by the blinkers. He's almost certainly still in decent form."
"Won | [RACE]: There were question marks over the current form of a number of these, and the race mightn't have been quite as competitive as it looked on paper, not that that should take much away from the lightly-raced winner who came right away in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: after 9 weeks off, was back to looking like the very promising sprinter he'd seemed when edging out Ava Go Joe early last season; mid-division, travelled well, good headway 2f out, led well over 1f out, drew clear final 1f, had plenty in hand; it clearly hasn't been plain sailing for him over the past 18 months, but he's still lightly raced and ought to take some stopping again if in the same form next time."
"2nd of 15, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive sprint dominated by those to race prominently, the winner battling back well having initially been headed over 1f out. | [HORSE]: is well into the veteran stage now but he retains ability and only just missed out in a head-bobbing finish. He isn't certain to be in the same form next time, however."
"3rd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A race that panned out in unorthodox fashion, the winner going off hard and soon well clear, just having enough left in the tank to hold off the favourite with nothing out the back ever threatening. | [HORSE]: must have had a problem last year, not seen after running poorly at Goodwood in June but he ran up to his best back from 10 months off despite having been very easy to back; awkward leaving stalls, mid-field, pushed along early in straight, headway over 1f out, ran on, nearest at the finish; he's done really well for this yard, and given his pattern-race winning dam was only reaching her peak as a 5-y-o, it's unlikely that Change Sings has reached his limit yet."
"5th of 14, competitive | [RACE]: A soundly-run handicap which looks standard form for the grade, the well-treated second coming home well to mark himself down as the most interesting looking forward. | [HORSE]: has dropped 26lb since joining this yard and took a step back in the right direction, despite a wide trip."
"5th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: Low-grade form that promises to work out, a couple of relatively unexposed 3-y-os pulling clear; the pace was sound. | [HORSE]: extended long losing run; in touch, pulled way to front after 2f, headed final 1f, weakening when hung badly right close home."
"Won | [RACE]: A run-of-the-mill class 6 handicap in which the gallop was steady and the emphasis was on speed, the winner well suited by how things developed. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden, after just 3 days off, ended long losing run, suited by the emphasis on speed stepped back up in trip; mid-field, went with zest, came wide entering straight, shaken up over 1f out, quickened to lead final 100 yds; he's come a long way down the weights and is unexposed beyond 1¼m."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A surprise last-to-first winner, though he did have more unexposed facets to his profile than the rest; the pace was a solid one. | [HORSE]: travelled best and looks ready to strike back at 6f."
"3rd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fair Northern handicap for exposed older horses on the face of it, but quite a few of these have slipped to attractive marks and it could be a race that'll throw up a couple of winners in the coming weeks. | [HORSE]: has been given a chance by the handicapper and this was his most encouraging run since returning from a long absence. He got messed about on a couple of occasions in the straight and he looks ready to strike."
"9th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A third of the field represented the 3-y-o generation but none found enough improvement to finish any closer than fifth to add to the feel of a weak affair in which a strong pace held up well. | [HORSE]: is a longstanding maiden but can be forgiven this as his jockey reported that the saddle slipped approaching the bend."
"7th of 8, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A useful performance from the remarkable winner who completed the 6-timer once more with plenty in hand. | [HORSE]: up 6lb for his recent Haydock win (4-9 there), can be forgiven this. He needs a solid pace to aim at which he didn't get, but even worse he was all dressed up with nowhere to go from before reaching the furlong pole."
"7th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: Few of these make much appeal, even in this grade, and the winner was able to build on last week's promise quite comfortably. | [HORSE]: ended last season out of form and was so again in first-time cheekpieces, though she shaped as if better for the run after 5 months off; made running, took keen hold, headed around 3f out, left behind gradually."
"6th of 6, competitive | [RACE]: A tightly-knit and slightly muddling minor event which produced a busy finish edged by one that has a good record with cut in the ground. | [HORSE]: was readily brushed aside and continues out of form."
"Won | [RACE]: The winner was always going best and was full value for her success - and possibly even a little more - but in edging across to the rail once in front she caused interference - either directly or indirectly - to 3 of her remaining 4 rivals, Ravenswell having in effect taken no part in the race. | [HORSE]: showed improved form to get off the mark switched to a handicap, always going sweetly; missed the break, mid-field, loomed up over 2f out, led soon after, idled late on, just kept up to work as second closed the gap near the line; will go on improving."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap well worth noting, the well-supported Chesspiece giving a form boost to the winner of the Lingfield Derby Trial and chased home by a collection of well-connected rivals that can expect to be figuring prominently in high-profile handicaps during the summer; Knockbrex set an honest pace and the first 2 made plenty of ground up in the straight. | [HORSE]: acquitted himself well faced with a much deeper race on turf debut, coming from a long way back in the straight and seeing out the 2f longer trip thoroughly, bumping into a good prospect and he'll be firmly on the shortlist again next time; in rear, headway under pressure 2f out, stayed on, nearest at the finish; will go on improving."
"5th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modest handicap on balance, the back-to-form winner well in control before veering over to the far rail in the final 1f. | [HORSE]: again under a penalty for Hamilton turned out quickly, is better judged on previous form, an awkward start making life a bit difficult this time; in touch, took keen hold, ridden 2f out, plugged on final 1f."
"3rd of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A strong gallop had plenty in trouble a long way out and an in-form pair that had sat just off the pace had it between them over 1f out, Brave Emerald always doing enough late on. | [HORSE]: turned out quickly and without the headgear this time, ran best race since debut, probably helped by being held up in a strongly-run race, his challenge now to back this up; raced well off the pace, steady headway approaching home turn, kept on straight, ran on late."
"8th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A strong pace soon had the field well strung out but it still proved difficult to make up ground in the conditions with the field coming over to the near side in the straight, Mudamer soon in front, grabbing the near rail and not for passing under a well-judged ride by Silvestre de Sousa. | [HORSE]: ran poorly in company that is perhaps a bit too hot for him (all 3 wins for stable in 0-60 company); mid-field, pushed along halfway, lost place early in straight."
"4th of 5, competitive | [RACE]: The unbeaten Minnie Wildes came a cropper switched to a handicap, no match for some more battled-hardeneed types with Queen's Guard putting a sequence of below-par efforts behind her; the early pace was just modest, the order not changing much. | [HORSE]: dropping back to 6f, found this company too hot."
"12th of 16, well beaten | [RACE]: A useful and competitive handicap that was run at a sound gallop with the first 5 all coming from mid-field or further back, things panning out ideally for Northern Express as he confirmed the promise of his recent C&D effort in this lesser company. | [HORSE]: is better judged on the form/promise of Beverley (especially with a view to going back there), doing too much too soon in a stronger race than he need contest; chased leaders, pushed along 3f out, struggling when hampered over 1f out, weakened."
"5th of 6, well beaten | [RACE]: A good gallop saw a finish reminiscent of the fibresand days at this track, Caballo de Mar the only one the market wanted to know and powering clear from 2f out, plainly on the up right now. | [HORSE]: after 3 months off, again finished well held, acknowledgng this was a better handicap than he need contest; slowly into stride, raced well off the pace, beaten home turn."
"14th of 17, well beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful apprentice handicap and a fiercely competitive race of its type, the first 4 never too far away and all relatively prominent in the betting, while a couple drawn out wide had plenty on and were better than the result. | [HORSE]: came here absolutely thriving and will probably be suited by 5f another time, having plenty on from his position here; poorly drawn, raced wide, held up, short of room over 1f out, made little impression; type to bounce back quickly."
"11th of 19, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A typically-competitive renewal of this fillies' sprint handicap, the draw not having as much of an effect as it often can in sprints here, the field spread across the track with the speedy Eclairage towing those drawn high into it, while the admirable Luna A Inbhir Nis gave a good lead to those drawn lower, the race essentially setting up for those ridden with a touch of patience, a Ryan Moore masterclass putting the winner's head in front on the line, while those 2 aforementioned prominent racers emerged with plenty of credit, the form looking solid all round. | [HORSE]: ran her first poor race of the season, not able to show her usual blazing speed and forced into chasing one who's even speedier; prominent until weakened over 1f out; type to bounce back quickly."
"7th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap which the 3-y-o winner always looked like taking once he'd kicked clear before the home turn, but the exposed runner-up suffered a torrid run through and could have been much closer. | [HORSE]: is best excused this run, getting a poor trip through in pursuit of the hat-trick; mid-field, short of room 3f out, hampered home turn, made little impression."
"9th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: A soundly-run affair, the pace set by the fourth and a couple made ground late on from off the gallop, but the first 2 were never far away and improved on their switch to handicaps. | [HORSE]: ran badly, even allowing for a poor trip; slowly into stride, raced very wide, mid-field, weakened 2f out."
"2nd of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap, though it was still a fairly smooth performance by the well-backed winner, who had a bit more in hand over the others in the frame than the bare margins might imply. | [HORSE]: who has form on dirt in Hong Kong, hadn't troubled the judge in four starts on turf for this yard, but the handicapper had dropped him 15lb as a result. He showed a lot more switched to the AW, up there the whole way despite racing rather keenly. He tended to wear a tongue-tie in Hong Kong, so getting that added might prove key."
"4th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Most of these are regulars on the all-weather circuit and it wasn't the deepest race by class 2 standards - all bar 2 of them would have got into a 0-95; the pace steadied briefly mid-race and, while it doesn't seem like there was any positional advantage, the runner-up can be considered a little unlucky considering the trouble he met in the straight. | [HORSE]: had been well beaten in his first two starts for this yard on soft and heavy ground, but he showed a lot more switched to the AW for the first time, staying on to the line. A winner (in the stewards' room) of a Listed race last year, he's on a fair mark now."
"5th of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A sprint handicap the market got completely wrong, Navello easy to back but producing a useful effort to confirm his recent return to form with a ready success, the unexposed favourite never really going after a sluggish start. | [HORSE]: under a 5lb penalty for her Yarmouth win, couldn't confirm that form with the fourth, switched to AW."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that was controlled from the front, Queues Likely making all with Miguel her closest pursuer throughout. | [HORSE]: hasn't looked back since switched to AW and she returned from a short break to complete her hat-trick under a beautifully-judged front-running ride. She had only managed third on her latest handicap outing, and that off a 14lb lower mark, which gives some indication of her progress on artificial surfaces. With another hike in the weights imminent, she may well find life much tougher in the short term."
"7th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A fair handicap run at a decent pace that saw the progressive winner take his form up a notch. | [HORSE]: again ran below form in first-time cheekpieces but it may be he is better on the all weather; handy, lost place under 2f out, one paced."
"9th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-level sprint that wasn't run at a flat-out gallop, resulting in a bunched finish. | [HORSE]: is better on the all weather but is best not judged on this down in trip in a first-time hood having blown the start; very slowly away, soon detached, headway over 1f out, never nearer."
"10th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: The conditions may have exaggerated the distances involved but the time was good and this was a performance of utmost dominance by Marching Mac, who was in a different county to all bar the runner-up at the line, one of the most needless examples of a ride for the whip committee to review given the margins involved at the line. | [HORSE]: was unsuited by conditions; led, headed when stumbled after 1f, remained prominent, weakened over 1f out."
"9th of 12, well beaten | [RACE]: A pair of improvers filled the first 2 places in this 3-y-o contest, the well-related winner landing a gamble on handicap debut, though things may have been different had the third not hung markedly under pressure in front. | [HORSE]: back on turf after 8 weeks off (in first-time cheekpieces), was possibly unsuited by conditions; dived right leaving stalls, led, headway before halfway, weakened from 2f out."
"4th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful handicap, but there was a lack of pace in the early stages and the race turned into something of a 2f dash, Silver Samurai well equipped to deal with that given his background at shorter as he edged a tight finish, but some of the beaten horses will be of greater interest next time, notably the runner-up. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form, this effort not dissimilar to last time in how it panned out, forced to challenge on the wing and from further back than ideal, but perhaps not the heartiest when it came to the crunch; dwelt, held up, travelled well, good headway from 3f out, switched left and pushed along over 1f out, upsides approaching final 100 yds, worried out of it; having been generously dropped 2 lb last time, he remains handicapped to win."
"4th of 5, competitive | [RACE]: Not a big field but it did produce an exciting finish, the front-running winner hanging on determinedly from one who's in decent heart; the pace was modest. | [HORSE]: settled better back down in trip but the final outcome was similar to last time; held up, brief headway under 2f out, no extra final 1f."
"6th of 11, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap in which they finished in a heap and hard to see this as anything more than ordinary form, the winner coming from behind but getting a clear run between rivals to cause a shock. | [HORSE]: is back down to his last winning mark and shaped well, deserving extra credit; hampered start, soon behind, pushed along home turn, still plenty to do 1f out, finished strongly after left poorly placed; won 3 times here last all-weather season and is one to be interested in again now."
"6th of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap featuring some interesting types but the pace was modest and luck in running played its part, the fourth really catching the eye from a long way back. | [HORSE]: shaped well back up in trip, not getting the clearest of runs and her mark remains workable; held up, travelled well, headway when short of room over 1f out, switched final 1f, kept on, not unduly punished, nearest at the finish, would have benefited from a stronger gallop; will remain of plenty of interest."
"Won | [RACE]: Solid form for the grade, the gallop sound and the winner capitalising on a slipping mark ahead of a last-time-out-winner and one that goes well at the track. | [HORSE]: unexposed on turf and racing off her lowest mark, became warm down at the start but picked up nicely against the rail. The stiff 6f suited and her trainer is having a good spell."
"5th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap in which it paid to be prominent, and not many of these are obviously progressive, the winner the exception, Gatecrasher Girl completing the hat-trick in cosy fashion. | [HORSE]: ran up to best; mid-division, pushed along over 2f out, kept on; is paying the price for a good spell during the winter and will remain vulnerable."
"11th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: A fair handicap in which it proved very difficult to get involved from off the pace, the order not changing a great deal throughout, Kelpie Grey soon in front and proving too tough to pass after several had a crack at him in the straight. | [HORSE]: in first-time cheekpieces, looked a hard ride; carried head awkwardly, always behind."
"7th of 8, well beaten | [RACE]: The trio of 3-y-os all arrived on the back of a win and came firmly to the fore with the gambled-on favourite filling the frame, giving the form a solid feel. | [HORSE]: looked a hard ride and continues to fall in the weights without showing any sign of taking advantage; refused to settle, wandered over 1f out, always behind."
"10th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: Though not quite so one-sided as the first division, the odds-on favourite was again a very comfortable winner of this handicap, Lethal Touch gaining his reward for a consistent spell. | [HORSE]: wasn't in the same form as last time, again looking a difficult ride; mid-field, lost place over 2f out, carried head awkwardly straight."
"Won | [RACE]: A small-field fillies' handicap that ended up rather disjointed with the field spread across the track in the straight, the least exposed of the quintet doing it readily despite showing signs of waywardness. | [HORSE]: made a successful start to handicaps despite proving a difficult ride. Although she veered towards the near side upon hitting the front, she found plenty once straightened up, and it she's bred to do better still."
"2nd of 14, involved in finish | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap run at a fierce gallop, the winner getting plenty of cover on the stand rail and striking decisively over 1f out. | [HORSE]: in a change of headgear, bounced back to form on his third run for the stable, having a more difficult run through than the winner but not unlucky in that regard, his main issue more the fact he didn't keep straight once in the clear; mid-division, had to pick way through from 3f out, headway when hung badly left approaching final 1f, ran on."
"6th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: Quite a messy handicap thanks to the antics of long-time leader French Haven entering the straight, a pair who charted a course on the inside of that hanging rival pulling clear, a cautious view of the form taken as a result. | [HORSE]: making handicap/all-weather debut, failed to improve after 6 months off and showed some quirks as well; led, shaken up over 2f out, hung badly right entering straight, headed soon after, faded."
"8th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A lowly handicap run at a modest pace and the winner bounced back from an attractive mark, foiling a gamble on the runner-up. | [HORSE]: minus the cheekpieces this time, ran poorly; mid-field, pulled hard, made little impression."
"5th of 12, competitive | [RACE]: A low-grade 3-y-o handicap, the first 2 both strong in the betting and showing fair form in fighting it out. | [HORSE]: fared no better in first-time blinkers, still too free; prominent, pulled hard, ridden over 1f out, weakened final 1f."
"5th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: Not a huge amount of depth to this 3-y-o handicap, though nevertheless the winner still improved to see off a pair of previous winners, despite still looking rough around the edges. | [HORSE]: back in cheekpieces, fared no better on turf debut; led, pushed along over 3f out, headed soon after, weakened."
"9th of 9, well beaten | [RACE]: A fair handicap that was steadily run, and while the well-backed favourite was the winner on merit, his superiority was exaggerated by the run of the race, Kodi Gold again shaping well from a long way back to get closest to him. | [HORSE]: dropped right out after setting the pace. She looks much better on turf on the evidence so far, but this was still a moderate performance."
"Won | [RACE]: A modestly-run 3-y-o handicap, the only progressive sort in the field coming out on top. | [HORSE]: was never far away and stamped his authority on proceedings inside the final furlong as he supplemented last month's C&D win off a 5lb higher mark. Now 2-2 around here and 2-3 on the AW, he'll remain open to more improvement on the AW and shouldn't be underestimated in better handicaps."
"Won | [RACE]: A grand title and good prize money for a handicap that probably represents solid form for the grade, the field coming down the centre for the most part and making for a fair race. | [HORSE]: back over his best distance, took his record over 6f to 4-7, against 0-8 over further. He remains open to more improvement as a sprinter."
"6th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: Not an especially strong race for the grade, certainly not chockful of in-form runners, but it produced a popular winner with a course specialist doing the job in a race which saw the pace hold up. | [HORSE]: possibly needed the run after 8 months off; raced wide, held up, headway 2f out, effort flattened out."
"10th of 14, well beaten | [RACE]: Those towards the top of the betting dominated this handicap, the veteran Croeso Cymraeg tanking along once more to score for the second time in 10 days. | [HORSE]: a winner on his final outing for S. Wattel (claimed €21,600), possibly needed run after 12 weeks off; slowly into stride, always behind."
"7th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: An open-looking nursery, though few got involved, the first 2 having the race between them a fair way out; the field went to the far rail in the last 2f or so. | [HORSE]: is best not judged on this run; slowly into stride, in rear, still going quite well when hampered and stumbled over 2f out, not recover."
"10th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful handicap that looks straightforward to assess, a couple who have been in form over the winter running down a more lightly-raced type who went like the best at the weights for much of the race while one or 2 in behind weren't seen to best effect, chiefly Badri and Westmorian. | [HORSE]: failed to repeat last effort, but is best not judged too harshly on this run, weakening quite quickly after knocked off his stride by the winner; mid-field, headway on inner home turn, pushed along 2f out, bumped over 1f out, edged left, weakened."
"4th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: A middle-grade handicap from which 3-y-os were excluded, not much depth to it, 4 of the 8 having been off at least 8 weeks, unusual for a handicap like this mid-summer, the winner though doing well to score after being boxed in, gaining her third success of the campaign, just an eighth win for her yard, those successes coming from just 4 horses. | [HORSE]: got a bit worked up in the stalls, which likely contributed to a slow start. That meant he was unable to adopt the front-running tactics which saw him to good effect on turf in the spring, but he did make enough late headway to think he's returned from a short break in reasonable form."
"3rd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A useful event in which a trio of well-weighted types came to the fore, Bond Chairman just clinging on from the fast-finishing Mondammej. | [HORSE]: ran creditably having been easy to back, encouragingly ending his sequence of slow starts, able to race a bit closer to the pace as a result; prominent, travelled well, led under pressure under 2f out, edged left entering final 1f, headed final 100 yds; he's very well handicapped if able to build on this, having won off 6 lb higher early in the year."
"Won | [RACE]: A low-grade staying handicap, a trio of 3-y-os at the head of the betting and the winner taking a step forward for a new trip. | [HORSE]: has a pedigree full of stamina and proved well suited by the step up in trip, looking as though he had a battle on his hands inside the final 2f but strong inside the last. He looks a young stayer to keep on side now he's running over the right trip."
"3rd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: Plenty of reliable sorts on show means this is form that should work out for all it didn't prove quite the test it's designed to be, a few not seen to best effect in a modestly-run affair. | [HORSE]: back on turf, ran creditably after 5 months off but he ideally needs more emphasis on stamina; led early, settled in touch, ridden over 2f out, short of room briefly 1f out, kept on."
"5th of 7, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A low-grade apprentice handicap in which the well-treated winner bounced back with the run of things, the pair that headed the market unsuited by how this developed. | [HORSE]: a three-time winner here, was keen enough and didn't find as much off the bridle as had seemed likely. He has been a bit inconsistent of late."
"Won | [RACE]: A fairly useful fillies' handicap that was run at a steady pace, the runner-up seen to maximum effect but picked off in the closing stages by one who has been knocking on the door. | [HORSE]: who'd run well two days earlier (RPR 85), can have this win upgraded considering she picked off the second in the straight, who'd had no pace pressure applied to her in front, having raced in rear. She's a mainly consistent filly and will continue to give a good account, while her Class 3 form figures now reads 21021."
"Won | [RACE]: The front pair were up there throughout in this ordinary handicap, the third the only one to make any significant inroads from off the pace. | [HORSE]: is an inconsistent sort, but he was on a going day this time and found the line coming to his rescue as he supplemented last season's Musselburgh maiden win. It's hard to be sure he'll repeat this level of form next time."
"9th of 10, fairly beaten | [RACE]: The well-supported winner was ideally placed in a steadily-run race, but still deserves credit for seeing it out as well as she did considering how keen she'd been early, for all she had much more of a ground-saving trip than the runner-up. | [HORSE]: is proving inconsistent; led, pushed along approaching 2f out, headed soon after, weakened final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap that went the way of an inconsistent sort on a going day, though the trio who chased him home all had something to recommend them beforehand, so the form looks solid enough. | [HORSE]: has been more miss than hit this year but, back on all-weather and in first-time visor, posted best effort of the year to cash in on dropping mark; raced off the pace, switched under 2f out, stayed on to lead final 50 yds; uncertain to be in the same form next time."
"4th of 4, well beaten | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap in which the favourite wasn't on his A-game, but the form still has some merit, the pair who beat him worth crediting with a bit of progression. | [HORSE]: ran poorly and has been more miss than hit of late; prominent, weakened from 2f out."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A weak handicap for the grade, which developed into a tactical race, the winner seen to advantage from the front, the tempo lifting only approaching the straight. | [HORSE]: looked the pick on form, off the same mark as at Southwell, and though he ran creditably, he was again perhaps not seen to maximum advantage against a well-ridden winner; in touch, travelled well, ridden entering straight, chased leader over 1f out, kept on, made little impression."
"3rd of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: Plenty of inconsistent sorts in this weak handicap but at least it went the way of the most reliable type; the pace was steady. | [HORSE]: flopped on turf last time but ran well back on all weather under a controlling ride, seen to maximum advantage as the race unfolded; dictated, quickened 4f out, pushed along 2f out, headed inside final 1f, no extra, well ridden."
"5th of 7, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A low-grade handicap fought out by a couple dropping in class, the winner having the run of things from the front, while the rest were well beaten off. | [HORSE]: back up in trip and returned to turf, wasn't seen to best effect and probably remains in form; dwelt, held up, travelled well, headway when switched inside 1f out, not quicken, would have benefited from a stronger gallop."
"6th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A standard handicap for the grade, the veteran winner seen to better effect than of late and getting there in the final stride. | [HORSE]: again wasn't seen to best effect and would have finished a place closer with a better passage; slowly into stride, took strong hold, not clear run under 2f out, headway under pressure soon after, keeping on when short of room late on."
"7th of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: A steadily-run handicap and the form wants treating with a degree of caution as a result, the only 3-y-o in the race always well placed and not fully extended to follow up a recent win. | [HORSE]: claimer ridden, fared little better despite having the run of things; dictated, headed over 1f out, soon beaten."
"6th of 11, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A useful contest, albeit a modestly-run one, in which a well-weighted sort and an in-form 3-y-o came to the fore, the pair both on the speed throughout, the frame completed by reliable types to offer some substance to the form; those towards the rear can either be upgraded or excused, most notably the returning Reputation. | [HORSE]: failed to justify support despite being able to have the run of things from the front, the first time he's failed to make the places at this track; led, quickened entering straight, headed 2f out, carried right soon after, faded final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: A muddling low-grade handicap which saw the field finish in a heap, the winning favourite controlling matters from her plum draw, both the second and third shaping better on the day, having had to wait for a run. | [HORSE]: finally got off the mark by a narrow margin, having been seen to maximum effect back up in trip; made all, quickened home turn, ridden 1f out, just held on, very much had the run of the race; circumstances unlikely to be so favourable next time."
"Won | [RACE]: A handicap that was run at a steady pace, several failing to settle, most notably the favourite who loomed up but couldn't get past the well-ridden winner who made all. | [HORSE]: back under a fully-fledged rider with Oisin Murphy replacing a 7 lb claimer, was aided by the return to front-running as he went one better than last time, though was seen to maximum effect under a well-judged ride; dictated, quickened on 2f out, edged right, kept going well to make all; circumstances aren't sure to be so favourable next time."
"16th of 16, well beaten | [RACE]: A 3-y-o event that's usually a deep contest, this running looking no exception with some strong form lines represented, as many 6 of them reappearing from the race won by Quinault at York last month, including the first 4 that day, and a trio from that contingent made the frame again along with a reliable type, the first 2 progressive and clear of the rest; they raced in one large group and, as can be the case here, it paid to be handy, Tough Enough best of those from the rear, whilst the majority of those who raced on the wings can either be excused or marked up, most notably Be Frank and Frankness. | [HORSE]: dropped away tamely, joint-trainer Ed Crisford reporting he would prefer a slower surface."
"4th of 8, competitive | [RACE]: A one-sided sprint handicap, the dominant winner amongst the less-exposed runners in the field and looking one to follow on the back of this impressive display. | [HORSE]: was unlucky not to finish closer, repeatedly meeting trouble as the race began to develop before finishing off in encouraging fashion, though he is the sort that needs things to drop right in any case; in rear, denied a run over 1f out, forced to switch and kept on inside final 1f."
"7th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: A one-sided handicap, Zambezi Magic taking well to testing conditions and recording a facile success, though the pair of 3-y-os who chased him home also offered something to work on; the field came stand side in the straight. | [HORSE]: fared no better; led, joined entering straight, carried head awkwardly, headed 3f out, dropped away; temperament under suspicion."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Solid handicap form for the level, the winner improving to readily see off a couple in second and fourth who arrived in good heart, with a nicely-bred handicap debutant in third, their efforts given substance by the timefigure. | [HORSE]: posted a sound enough effort in defeat after coming wide into the straight. He was always playing catch up against the more forwardly ridden winner and never troubled that rival."
"8th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: An absolute blanket finish means the form of his very ordinary 3-y-o affair needs treating with some caution, but the winner did very well to win, not just on account of the position he came from but having been particularly keen, too. | [HORSE]: who attracted support, wasn't seen to very best effect; held up, effort out wide over 2f out, one paced."
"11th of 11, well beaten | [RACE]: A 3-y-o handicap dominated by those ridden close to the pace, Dovey Moon very much in pole position against the stand rail and a good chance this will prove to be flattering. | [HORSE]: offered little upped to 1m after 4 months off (left Dominic Ffrench Davis); always behind."
"2nd of 8, involved in finish | [RACE]: A competitive race - all bar one had won or been placed on his most recent outing - shaped by a contested pace, the principals coming from mid-field or further back. | [HORSE]: is a standing dish on Tapeta at Newcastle (four wins there) but with a similar surface now in situ at Southwell this should open up more opportunities. He missed the break here, and truthfully is handicapped to the hilt, as a victim of his own consistency. He possibly just saves a little for himself in any driving finish."
"7th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: The testing ground suited both of the first 2 in this sprint handicap, Blind Beggar showing good speed to go clear 1f out but caught by the powerful finish of the gambled-on favourite. | [HORSE]: was amiss (reportedly bled); in touch, ridden halfway, weakened over 1f out."
"2nd of 12, involved in finish | [RACE]: A solid handicap for the grade but the returning winner proved a cut above starting out for a new yard after an absence, readily accounting for a couple that have been in good order recently. | [HORSE]: backed up his win with a good effort, unlucky to bump into one on a very good mark; held up, travelled fluently, headway under pressure over 1f out, short of room briefly final 1f, kept on, no match for winner; will continue to give a good account."
"4th of 12, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A basement-grade nursery, the gambled-on winner proving a different proposition on nursery debut; the field was quickly strung out courtesy of Miss Ayala and Molly Mac taking each other on up top. | [HORSE]: was sent off favourite but made hard work of things in first-time cheekpieces, a step up in trip seemingly the way to go; soon behind, never travelling well, short of room over 2f out, headway over 1f out, ran on, nearest at the finish."
"Won | [RACE]: Surely nothing other than flimsy form, a much steadier gallop than the preceding 0-55 seeing the quintet finish in a heap on the stand rail with the short-priced favourite unable to get a run. | [HORSE]: came out on top in a messy affair, a first winner for his stable since October 2021; in touch, effort under 3f out, headway to lead final 100 yds; uncertain to reproduce this form next time."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: A modest handicap that was won in comfortable fashion by one from the front, little able to get into things from off the pace, Munificent shaping well in that regard. | [HORSE]: took a strong hold out the back, too far off the speed given how this played out, and was wide on the turn in. He's not straightforward but again shaped like he's in the form to win when a race unfolds to suit - he was one place ahead of today's winner at Lingfield last time."
"6th of 7, competitive | [RACE]: A useful contest and the form has a strong look to it, the winner back on the up at the chief expense of a pair that came into it on the back of career bests; the pace was sound and things got tight for a couple as the leaders came back to them close home. | [HORSE]: a C&D winner in July, blew the start and was a bit short of room late, so may be worth another chance."
"8th of 10, well beaten | [RACE]: A useful handicap run at only a modest gallop, the first 2 worth marking up, especially the winner, who looked as good as ever in making a successful return from a lengthy absence over a trip short of his best. | [HORSE]: who goes well at this track (5 of her 6 career wins here), again ran below form, though was looked after once held; slowly into stride, in rear, ridden 3f out, brief headway soon after, no extra final 1f, not knocked about."
"8th of 11, competitive | [RACE]: A good and competitive race on paper, and although the gallop was slow to halfway, it picked up far enough out to allow some of those held up to get involved. | [HORSE]: stopped the slide, and wasn't given a hard time; dwelt, raced well off the pace, hung left over 1f out, not knocked about, some late headway."
"2nd of 6, involved in finish | [RACE]: An ordinary race for the grade with the odds-on favourite disappointing, Caroline Dale not needing to improve to double her career tally. | [HORSE]: produced a career best from 7 lb out of the weights returned to 5f after just 3 days off, typically going with plenty of enthusiasm and yet to finish out of the places since the visor was applied; led, around 3 lengths clear halfway, ridden over 2f out, tackled entering final 1f, edged out final 100 yds."
"2nd of 18, involved in finish | [RACE]: This wasn't short of below-par efforts but the winner had returned flourishing and kept the similarly patiently-ridden runner-up at arm's length having made a sweeping move to the front further wide than the others; Happy overdid the front-running role, the third/fourth others to come from the back. | [HORSE]: ran another solid race, going down only to a thriving mare. He has until a week on Friday to go off the same mark and will look favourably treated if he does."
"4th of 14, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A strong gallop on bad ground took most of these out of their comfort zone and there were only a couple who ever looked like winning, Hodler gaining the upper hand 1f out; with the ground so chewed up the inside looked disadvantaged, the winner having circled the field. | [HORSE]: who'd won this race in 2021, shaped as if still in good form, faring best of those towards the chewed-up inside; tracked pace, effort over 2f out, one paced."
"11th of 16, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A typically competitive race for the grade, the pace strong and the field racing in one group down the centre, though the main action developed towards the far side at the business end, the runner-up faring best of those that raced prominently. | [HORSE]: who sweated up beforehand, blew the start and could never get competitive; very slowly away, in rear, some late headway."
"11th of 13, well beaten | [RACE]: A competitive affair run at a true gallop, challengers emerging from everywhere in the latter stages, the winner getting there quite late, though the eye was drawn to the third who came even later. | [HORSE]: should strip fitter for the run after 11 months off, a big move to the front around halfway ensuring his fitness was tested to the full; raced wide, mid-division, disputed lead halfway, went on over 3f out, headed over 2f out, faded final 1f."
"9th of 13, fairly beaten | [RACE]: It was only Austrian Theory's late progress that prevented a clean sweep of the places for 3-y-os and this has the hallmarks of very solid form, the first 4 all interesting for one reason or another and a little way clear of last year's winner, with the highly progressive Crowd Quake not seen to anything like best effect a place further back. | [HORSE]: in first-time tongue strap, had a productive time last autumn but is starting to look as though he's gone off the boil this time round; chased leaders until 2f out, outpaced gradually."
"6th of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: A well-contested handicap as it should be for the money on offer, and there's little reason to doubt the form, with a quartet of unexposed/progressive 3-y-o fillies - 3 of which were last-time-out winners - fighting out the finish and little to separate them at the line, the fourth doing best of the hold-up contingent and likely to have got up in another stride or 2. | [HORSE]: under a 6-lb penalty in a warmer handicap than previously, couldn't quite see her race out having raced too freely; settled mid-field after 2f, headway when hung left over 2f out, pushed along soon after, no extra last ½f."
"13th of 20, well beaten | [RACE]: A well-contested 0-80 run at a start-stop gallop which left a few fighting for their heads but the market principals came to the fore and it should prove a really solid piece of form, the first 2 - who made their challenges on opposite flanks - both thriving, the way Dawn of Liberation powered clear of them impressive. | [HORSE]: surprisingly dropped back even further in trip, looked a hard ride; dwelt, raced well off the pace, refused to settle, hung left over 2f out, steady progress under 2f out, no further impression."
"4th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: All bar one of the 3-y-os came to the fore in a race with a dramatic conclusion, a last-time-out winner who passed the post first causing significant interference to the short-priced favourite over 1f out and the result overturned in a stewards inquiry; there was a tailwind and nothing got involved from further back than mid-field. | [HORSE]: broke on terms this time and benefited from the step back up to 6f for the first time this season, beaten by a trio of 3-y-os; mid-field, headway under pressure under 2f out, kept on well last ½f; placed twice from marks in the high 70s last season and not one to write off, the yard enduring a fruitful season."
"Won | [RACE]: Not much of a race, and it was turned into a procession by one who was taking advantage of a basement-grade mark to record a first turf success. | [HORSE]: settled better this time and recorded his first success away from all-weather, belatedly proving himself equally effective on turf despite having a lower mark in this sphere; prominent, led over 1f out, forged clear; will remain well treated on old form and a follow up can't be ruled out if he's in the same mood next time."
"7th of 7, well beaten | [RACE]: A pretty unsatisfactory outcome to a trappy staying contest, Golden Rules able to make all having been given a particularly easy time of things in front. | [HORSE]: blew the start and had little chance how things unravelled after; very slowly away, raced well off the pace, brief headway out wide entering straight, no extra before final 1f."
"Won | [RACE]: A strong pace ensured the field finished well strung out, to the extent that only the first 3 could be considered to have given their running, the winner getting a dream run through and showing a jolt of improvement. | [HORSE]: was in an even lower grade than last time and was able to go one better, but surely showed a good deal of improvement given how decisive a winner she proved; mid-division, smooth headway on inner approaching home turn, led 1f out, quickened clear."
"3rd of 13, involved in finish | [RACE]: The front pair dominated this useful handicap, the winner collaring the runner-up late on, while the third is worth a bit of extra credit having come from much further back. | [HORSE]: couldn't go the early gallop but stuck to his guns late on towards the far side, not disgraced in the end; outpaced in rear, headway from 2f out, stayed on final 1f, nearest at the finish."
"6th of 9, fairly beaten | [RACE]: A fairly useful contest in which the first 3 had all met last time and it was Youthful King who came out on top on this occasion in fine style, the third best of those from the rear at a track which tends to favour those on the speed. | [HORSE]: proved retains ability at the second attempt after a year off, this run possibly still needed a touch; in touch, effort 2f out, beaten when edged left entering final 1f, not persevered with once held."
"2nd of 5, involved in finish | [RACE]: It was perhaps on the cards that this would test speed more than stamina with only 5 runners lining up, Brindavan's turn of foot 2f out proving decisive. | [HORSE]: took them along but got done for toe when the pace picked up in the straight, dropping back to third before running on again inside the last. It's been a similar story over shorter, and it seems it's a case of him needing a stronger gallop than more distance."
"Won | [RACE]: With a couple of hat-trick seekers on show and a 3-y-o making a winning switch to handicaps, this should prove solid form for a race of its type, even if they didn't go much of a gallop. | [HORSE]: , up in trip on handicap debut, was noted travelling strongly before finding a change of gear when daylight appeared, and she won going away. She's entitled to come on a bit for this first run in four months - her first turf start - and she should make up into a progressive handicapper."
"6th of 10, involved in finish | [RACE]: This looks like solid form for the level, the pair that filled the first 2 places both recent course winners, while the veteran in third is back down to a fair mark and ran his best race in a while. | [HORSE]: shaped as if still in good form, just not seen to best effect this time; in touch, ridden when denied a run and forced to switch over 1f out, brief headway soon after, no extra late on."
"2nd of 7, involved in finish | [RACE]: A rather disappointing turnout for the prize money on offer but the pair who came a little way clear in a modestly-run affair are both of interest, the odds-on favourite looking to have this in the bag but collared late on by one who's made a generally positive start for current connections. | [HORSE]: a creditable fourth in the Copper Horse Handicap at Royal Ascot, was a touch keen down in grade, but after going for home in the straight was caught in the final strides. He left the impression he is still on a workable mark but will be suited by a stronger gallop."
"12th of 14, well beaten | [RACE]: A new addition to the Derby Day card, essentially just a standard 0-90 3-y-o handicap, though bearing a more prestigious title, the winner making the most of a stand-side pitch to run down a pair of rivals who’d gone at it hammer and tongs in the centre from the off, several further back not looking entirely comfortable on the track. | [HORSE]: never figured on this turf debut but her jockey's early manoeuvre earned him a six-day careless riding ban."
"2nd of 9, involved in finish | [RACE]: Over half this field were reopposing from a C&D handicap a fortnight earlier and again minor honours was the best they could do, as the first 2 asserted emphatically; the leaders pressed on fully 5f out, which proved premature in the conditions. | [HORSE]: up 4lb for Nottingham, couldn't have tried any harder and, with the winner, pulled clear of the remainder. She'll go up again for this."
"5th of 9, competitive | [RACE]: A good quality sprint handicap in which the pace held up, the least exposed runner in the field just edging it. | [HORSE]: wasn't seen to best effect refitted in cheekpieces, on the back foot early in a race where nothing got involved from behind; bumped start, in rear, steady headway 2f out, plugged on."
"Won | [RACE]: Not the strongest race for the grade and a modest pace meant it paid to race handily, the prolific winner seen to maximum advantage, whilst it's easy to forgive the favourite his effort. | [HORSE]: won by a full length this time, which is his equivalent of bolting up. He was weak in the market, but got away well and was soon in control on the front end. Saving plenty before winding things up in the straight, he never looked in much danger. He's now won seven of his last eight starts, and for as long as he's allowed to dictate on his own terms he'll remain hard to beat."
