    "1. BETTER THAN RESULT - This is crucial for finding value:\n",
    "   - Did the horse run better than the finishing position suggests?\n",
    "   - Consider: finishing position vs distance beaten vs manner of performance\n",
    "   - A horse finishing 4th beaten 2 lengths after a slow start shows more promise than a horse finishing 2nd beaten 8 lengths\n",
    "   - Look for: \"stayed on well\", \"unlucky in running\", \"against the bias\", \"caught late\", \"ran on strongly\"\n",
    "   - Pace bias indicators: \"front runners dominated\" vs \"finished strongly\"\n",
    "   - Trip issues: \"wide throughout\", \"hampered\", \"slow start\", \"check in running\"\n",
    "   - Positive signs: \"only just held\", \"closing fast\", \"eye-catching\", \"green/inexperienced\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. RACE STRENGTH:\n",
    "   - \"modestly-run\" / \"ordinary bunch\" = weak\n",
    "   - \"competitive\" / \"good field\" = strong\n",
    "   - Winner's margin and manner important\n",
    "   - Time/sectionals if mentioned\n",
    "\n",
    "3. PERFORMANCE QUALITY:\n",
    "   - Effort level vs ability shown\n",
    "   - Improvement from previous runs\n",
    "   - How horse traveled through race\n",
    "   - Consider finishing position AND distance beaten together\n",
    "\n",
    "4. DISTANCE CLUES:\n",
    "   - \"stayed on\" / \"finishing well\" = wants longer\n",
    "   - \"outpaced\" / \"faded\" = shorter or different pace\n",
    "   - \"travelling well until...\" = trip analysis\n",
    "   - Early pace vs finishing kick\n",
    "\n",
    "5. FUTURE INTEREST:\n",
    "   - Horses better than result = high interest\n",
    "   - Improvement shown = follow\n",
    "   - \"Type to do better\" = potential\n",
    "   - Handicap implications\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY PHRASES THAT INDICATE BETTER THAN RESULT:\n",
    "- \"stayed on well despite...\"\n",
    "- \"unlucky in running\"\n",
    "- \"against the run of play\"  \n",
    "- \"caught the eye\"\n",
    "- \"ran on strongly\"\n",
    "- \"only just held\"\n",
    "- \"closed fast\"\n",
    "- \"better than result suggests\"\n",
    "- \"made good late progress\"\n",
    "- \"green/inexperienced but showed ability\"\n",
    "- \"slow start but finished well\"\n",
    "- \"wide throughout but kept on\"\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLES OF BETTER THAN RESULT:\n",
    "- Finished 5th but only beaten 3 lengths in strong field = much_better\n",
    "- Won by 8 lengths in weak race = about_right or worse\n",
    "- 3rd beaten 1 length after wide trip = better\n",
